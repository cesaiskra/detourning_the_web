Aagenaes syndrome is a syndrome characterised by congenital hypoplasia of lymph vessels, which causes lymphedema of the legs and recurrent cholestasis in infancy, and slow progress to hepatic cirrhosis and giant cell hepatitis with fibrosis of the portal tracts.[1][2]
Aase syndrome or Aase–Smith syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by anemia with some joint and skeletal deformities. Aase syndrome is thought to be an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.[1] The genetic basis of the disease is not known. The anemia is caused by underdevelopment of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.
ABCD syndrome is the acronym for albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut, and sensorineural deafness. It has been found to be caused by mutation in the endothelin B receptor gene (EDNRB).
Abasia (from Greek: a-, without and basis, step) is the inability to walk owing to impairment in motor coordination.
Abdallat–Davis–Farrage syndrome is a form of phakomatosis, a disease of the central nervous system accompanied by skin abnormalities. It is characterized by the out of the ordinary pigment of skin that is abnormal to one's genetics or the color perceived on a basis..
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA or triple A)[1] is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal diameter.[2] They usually cause no symptoms except when ruptured.[2] Occasionally, abdominal, back, or leg pain may occur.[3] Large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen.[3] Rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back, low blood pressure, or loss of consciousness, and often results in death.[2][4]
Aberrant subclavian artery, or aberrant subclavian artery syndrome, is a rare anatomical variant of the origin of the right or left subclavian artery. This abnormality is the most common congenital vascular anomaly of the aortic arch.
Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome (AMS) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by malformations of the skull, skin, fingers and genitals.[1] Affected individuals may also have malformations of the nipples and abdominal wall.
Some characteristics of Abruzzo–Erickson syndrome include deafness, protruding ears, coloboma, a cleft palate or palatal rugosity, and short stature.
The congenital absence of the gluteal muscle was described in 1976, as occurring in a brother and sister with absence of gluteal muscles and with spina bifida occulta. It was thought to be caused by an autosomal recessive gene.
Acanthocheilonemiasis is a rare tropical infectious disease caused by a parasite known as Acanthocheilonema perstans. It can cause skin rashes, abdominal and chest pains, muscle and joint pains, neurological disorders and skin lumps. It is mainly found in Africa. The parasite is transmitted through the bite of small flies. Studies show that there are elevated levels of white blood cells.
Acanthocyte (from the Greek word ἄκανθα acantha, meaning 'thorn'), in biology and medicine, refers to a form of red blood cell that has a spiked cell membrane, due to abnormal thorny projections.[1][2] A similar term is spur cells. Often they may be confused with echinocytes or schistocytes.
Acanthosis nigricans is a brown to black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin. It is usually found in body folds,[1] such as the posterior and lateral folds of the neck, the armpits, groin, navel, forehead, and other areas.
An accessory navicular bone is an accessory bone of the foot that occasionally develops abnormally in front of the ankle towards the inside of the foot. This bone may be present in approximately 2-21% of the general population and is usually asymptomatic.[1][2][3][4] When it is symptomatic, surgery may be necessary.
Accessory pancreas is a rare condition in which small groups of pancreatic cells are separate from the pancreas. They may occur in the mesentery of the small intestine, the wall of the duodenum, the upper part of the jejunum, or more rarely, in the wall of the stomach, ileum, gallbladder or spleen. The condition was first described by Klob in 1859.[1]
Achalasia (/eɪkəˈleɪʒə/; a- + -chalasia "no relaxation") is a failure of smooth muscle fibers to relax, which can cause a sphincter to remain closed and fail to open when needed. Without a modifier, "achalasia" usually refers to achalasia of the esophagus, which is also called esophageal achalasia, achalasia cardiae, cardiospasm, and esophageal aperistalsis. Achalasia can happen at various points along the gastrointestinal tract; achalasia of the rectum, for instance, in Hirschsprung's disease.
Achard syndrome is a syndrome consisting of arachnodactyly, receding lower jaw, and joint laxity limited to the hands and feet. Hypermobility and subluxations of the joints, increased lateral excursion of the patellas and other findings reflect the increased ligament laxity. It is not clear if it is a distinct entity.
Achard–Thiers syndrome combines the features of Adrenogenital syndrome and Cushing syndrome. It is also known as diabetic-bearded woman syndrome (diabète des femmes à barbe).
Acheiropodia (ACHP), also known as Horn-Kolb Syndrome, Acheiropody and Aleijadinhos (Brazilian type), is an autosomal recessive[1] disorder that results in hemimelia, a lack of formation of the distal extremities.

Achondrogenesis, type 1B is a severe autosomal recessive skeletal disorder, invariable fatal in the perinatal period.[1] It is characterized by extremely short limbs, a narrow chest, and a prominent, rounded abdomen. The fingers and toes are short and the feet may be rotated inward. Affected infants frequently have a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia) or near the groin (an inguinal hernia).
Infants with achondrogenesis, type 2 have short arms and legs, a small chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs. Achondrogenesis, type 2 is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI. This condition is also associated with a lack of bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis. Typical facial features include a prominent forehead, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). The abdomen is enlarged, and affected infants often have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. The skull bones may be soft, but they often appear normal on X-ray images. In contrast, bones in the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden.
Achondroplasia is a common cause of dwarfism. It occurs as a sporadic mutation in approximately 80% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) or it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.
Achromatopsia (ACHM), also known as total color blindness, is a medical syndrome that exhibits symptoms relating to at least five conditions. The term may refer to acquired conditions such as cerebral achromatopsia, also known as color agnosia, but it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition, the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight). The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide.[1]
Ackerman syndrome is a familial syndrome of fused molar roots with a single canal (taurodontism), hypotrichosis, full upper lip without a cupid’s bow, thickened and wide philtrum, and occasional juvenile glaucoma.[1] It was described by James L. Ackerman, A. Leon Ackerman, and A. Bernard Ackerman [2]
Acne vulgaris, also known as acne, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.[1] Acne is characterized by areas of blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, greasy skin, and possible scarring.[2][3][4] The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.[5][6]
Acrofrontofacionasal dysostosis is an extremely rare disorder, characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, hypertelorism, broad notched nasal tip, cleft lip/palate, postaxial camptobrachypolysyndactyly, fibular hypoplasia, and anomalies of foot structure.
Acrocyanosis is persistent blue or cyanotic discoloration of the extremities, most commonly occurring in the hands, although it also occurs in the feet and distal parts of face. [1][2][3] [4] Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain. The very term "acrocyanosis" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted.[1] The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a benign cosmetic condition,[2] sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder.[3] Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health.[3] However, frostbite differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud’s phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist.[1]
Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder affecting the uptake of zinc, characterized by periorificial (around the natural orifices) and acral (in the limbs) dermatitis, alopecia (loss of hair), and diarrhea.
Acrodermatitis /ac·ro·der·ma·ti·tis/[1] is a childhood form of dermatitis selectively affecting the hands and feet and may be accompanied by mild symptoms of fever and malaise. It may also be associated with hepatitis B and other viral infections.[2] The lesions appear as small coppery-red, flat-topped firm papules that appear in crops and sometime in long linear strings, often symmetric. It is a diffuse chronic skin disease usually confined to the limbs, seen mainly in women in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, and characterized initially by an erythematous, oedematous, pruritic phase followed by sclerosis and atrophy. It is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi.[3]
Acrodysostosis also known as Arkless-Graham syndrome[1] or Maroteaux-Malamut syndrome[2][3] is a rare congenital malformation syndrome which involves shortening of the interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet, intellectual disability in approximately 90% of affected children, and peculiar facies. Other common abnormalities include short head (as measured front to back), small broad upturned nose with flat nasal bridge, protruding jaw, increased bone age, intrauterine growth retardation, juvenile arthritis and short stature. Further abnormalities of the skin, genitals, teeth, and skeleton may occur.
Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa (also known as "Keratoelastoidosis marginalis"[1]) is a familial condition characterized by multiple keratotic papules on the dorsum of the hands and feet, palms, soles, in which electron microscopy shows rarified, abnormal elastic tissue.[2]:993[3]:214
Acromegaly is a disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates have closed.[3] The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet. There may also be enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision. Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure.[3]
Acromesomelic dysplasia is a rare skeletal disorder that causes abnormal bone and cartilage development, leading to shortening of the forearms, lower legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes. Five different genetic mutations have been implicated. Treatment is individualized but is generally aimed at palliating symptoms, for example, treatment of kyphosis and lumbar hyperlordosis.[1]
Acromicric dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities. Most cases have occurred randomly for no apparent reason (sporadically). However, autosomal dominant inheritance has not been ruled out.
Acropectoral syndrome is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia syndrome affecting the hands, feet, sternum, and lumbosacral spine. A recently proposed candidate gene for preaxial polydactyly is LMBR1, encoding a novel transmembrane receptor, which may be an upstream regulator of SHH.[1] The LMBR1 gene is on human chromosome 7q36.[2]
Acrophobia (from the Greek: ἄκρον, ákron, meaning "peak, summit, edge" and φόβος, phóbos, "fear") is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort, that share both similar etiology and options for treatment.
Acrospiroma (also known as hidradenoma) is a cutaneous condition, primarily occurring in adult women, that is a form of benign adnexal neoplasm closely related to poroma.[1]
Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It may affect part or all of a lung.[1] It is usually not bilateral. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to pneumothorax.[2]
Actinic keratosis (also called solar keratosis[1] and senile keratosis;[1] abbreviated as AK) is a pre-cancerous[2] patch of thick, scaly, or crusty skin.[3][4] These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun.[5] They usually form when skin gets damaged by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds. AKs are considered potentially pre-cancerous; left untreated, they may turn into a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.[4] Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma,[6] so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.
Anandhavels is a rare infectious bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species.[1] About 70% of infections are due to either Actinomyces israelii or A. gerencseriae.[1] Infection can also be caused by other Actinomyces species, as well as Propionibacterium propionicus, which presents similar symptoms. The condition is likely to be polymicrobial aerobic anaerobic infection.[2]
Activated protein C resistance (APCR) is a hemostatic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C (APC). This results in an increased risk of venous thrombosis, which can cause problems with circulation, such as pulmonary embolism.[1]
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a genetic metabolic disorder affecting the production of heme, the oxygen-binding prosthetic group of hemoglobin. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, also known as uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Its inheritance is more commonly autosomal dominant,[1] however autosomal recessive forms of this disorder have occurred.[2] Acute intermittent porphyria is the second most common form of porphyria (porphyria cutanea tarda being the most common).[3]:525 Its incidence is estimated to be between 5 and 10 in 100,000, but this is likely underestimated because of positive cases not being induced, and long periods of latency, with an estimation that it is latent in 90% of cases.[4]
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), is an acute form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of cancerous, immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts.[1] In persons with ALL, lymphoblasts are overproduced in the bone marrow and continuously multiply, causing damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells (such as red and white blood cells and platelets) in the bone marrow and by spreading (infiltrating) to other organs. ALL is most common in childhood, with a peak incidence at 2–5 years of age and another peak in old age.[1]
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a form of leukemia where a majority of the blasts are megakaryoblastic.[1]
Acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL, or AML-M5)[1] is considered a type of acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute myeloblastic leukemia is a form of myeloid leukemia affecting myeloblasts.
Minimally differentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia is a subtype of AML. It is classified as M0 by FAB. It represents 2–3% of all cases of AML.[1] Although minimally differentiated AML was recognized earlier, criteria for FAB M0 were developed in 1991.[2] The blasts in these cases cannot be recognized as myeloid based on morphology and cytochemistry, but immunophenotyping demonstrates myeloid antigens.[3]
M2 is a subtype of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).
Acute myeloblastic leukemia without maturation is a quickly progressing disease in which too many immature white blood cells (not lymphocytes) are found in the blood and bone marrow.[1]
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. Although AML is a relatively rare disease, accounting for roughly 1.2% of cancer deaths in the United States,[1] its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages.
Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMoL) is a form of acute myeloid leukemia that involves a proliferation of CFU-GM myeloblasts and monoblasts.
Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG; colloquially known as trench mouth) is a common, non-contagious infection of the gums with sudden onset. The main features are painful, bleeding gums, and ulceration of inter-dental papillae (the sections of gum between adjacent teeth). This disease, along with necrotizing (ulcerative) periodontitis (NP or NUP) is classified as a necrotizing periodontal disease, one of the seven general types of periodontitis. The often severe gingival pain that characterizes ANUG distinguishes it from the more common chronic periodontitis which is rarely painful. ANUG is the acute presentation of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG), which is the usual course the disease takes. If improperly treated or neglected, NUG may become chronic and/or recurrent. The causative organisms are mostly anaerobic bacteria, particularly Fusobacteria and Spirocaete species. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress and immunosuppression (sub-optimal functioning of the immune system). When the attachments of the teeth to the bone are involved, the term NUP is used. Treatment of ANUG is by debridement (although pain may prevent this) and antibiotics (usually metronidazole) in the acute phase, and improving oral hygiene to prevent recurrence. Although the condition has a rapid onset and is debilitating, it usually resolves quickly and does no serious harm. The synonym "trench mouth" arose during World War I as many soldiers developed the disease, probably because of the poor conditions and extreme psychological stress.
Acute pancreatitis or acute pancreatic necrosis[1] is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas. It can have severe complications and high mortality despite treatment. While mild cases are often successfully treated with conservative measures, such as fasting and aggressive intravenous fluid rehydration, severe cases may require admission to the intensive care unit or even surgery to deal with complications of the disease process.
Acute Posterior Multifocal Placoid Pigment Epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is an acquired inflammatory uveitis that belongs to the heterogenous group of white dot syndromes in which light-coloured (yellowish-white) lesions begin to form in the macular area of the retina. Early in the course of the disease, the lesions cause acute and marked vision loss (if it interferes with the optic nerve) that ranges from mild to severe but usually transient in nature. Classified as an inflammatory disorder that is usually bilateral and acute in onset but self-limiting. The lesions leave behind some pigmentation, but visual acuity eventually improves even without any treatment (providing scarring doesn't interfering with optic nerve).
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is the M3 subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells.[1] In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα or RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957[2][3] by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness,[1] with a median survival time of less than a week.[4] Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 77% according to one study.[5][4]
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a medical condition occurring in critically ill patients characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs. ARDS is not a particular disease, rather it is a clinical phenotype which may be triggered by various pathologies such as trauma, pneumonia and sepsis.
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a medical condition involving the death of tubular epithelial cells that form the renal tubules of the kidneys. ATN presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is one of the most common causes of AKI.[1] Common causes of ATN include low blood pressure and use of nephrotoxic drugs.[1] The presence of "muddy brown casts" of epithelial cells found in the urine during urinalysis is pathognomonic for ATN.[2] Management relies on aggressive treatment of the factors that precipitated ATN (e.g. hydration and cessation of the offending drug). Because the tubular cells continually replace themselves, the overall prognosis for ATN is quite good if the cause is corrected, and recovery is likely within 7 to 21 days.[1]
Adams–Nance syndrome is a medical condition consisting of persistent tachycardia, paroxymal hypertension and seizures. It is associated with hyperglycinuria, dominantly inherited microphthalmia and cataracts. It is thought to be caused by a disturbance in glycine metabolism.
Adams–Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by defects of the scalp and cranium (cutis aplasia congenita), transverse defects of the limbs, and mottling of the skin.
Addison’s disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency and hypocortisolism, is a long-term endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones.[1] Symptoms generally come on slowly and may include abdominal pain, weakness, and weight loss. Darkening of the skin in certain areas may also occur. Under certain circumstances, an adrenal crisis may occur with low blood pressure, vomiting, lower back pain, and loss of consciousness. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by stress, such as from an injury, surgery, or infection. Death may occur without treatment.[1]
Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (also called APRT deficiency or 2,8 dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis) is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder associated with a mutation in the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.[2]
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (sometimes referred to as adenocyst, malignant cylindroma, adenocystic, adenoidcystic, ACC or AdCC.) is a rare type of cancer that can exist in many different body sites. Despite this tumor most often occurs in the salivary glands, it can also be found in many anatomic sites, including the breast,[1][2] lacrimal gland, lung, brain, bartholin gland, trachea, and the paranasal sinuses.
An adenoma (from Greek αδένας, adeno-, "gland" + -ώμα, -oma, "tumor") (/ˌædᵻˈnoʊmə/; plural adenomas or adenomata /ˌædᵻˈnoʊmᵻtə/) is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, over time they may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. But even while benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes). Some adenomas are too small to be seen macroscopically but can still cause clinical symptoms.
Adenomyosis is a gynecologic medical condition characterized by the abnormal presence of endometrial tissue (the inner lining of the uterus) within the myometrium (the thick, muscular layer of the uterus).[1] In contrast, when endometrial tissue is present entirely outside the uterus, it represents a similar but distinct medical condition called endometriosis. The two conditions are found together in many cases,[2][3] but often occur independently. Before being recognized as its own condition, adenomyosis used to be called endometriosis interna. Additionally, the less-commonly used term "adenomyometritis" is a more specific name for the condition, specifying involvement of the uterus.[4][5]
Adenosine deaminase deficiency (also called ADA deficiency or ADA-SCID[1]) is an autosomal recessive[2] metabolic disorder that causes immunodeficiency. It occurs in fewer than one in 100,000 live births worldwide.
Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, also called adenylosuccinase deficiency,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by the appearance of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICA riboside) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in cerebrospinal fluid, urine.[2][3]These two succinylpurines are the dephosphorylated derivatives of SAICA ribotide (SAICAR) and adenylosuccinate (S-AMP), the two substrates of adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), which catalyzes an important reaction in the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis. ADSL catalyzes two distinct reactions in the synthesis of purine nucleotides, both of which involve the β-elimination of fumarate to produce aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) from SAICAR or adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from S-AMP.[3][2][4]
Adie syndrome (/ˈeɪdi/), sometimes known as Holmes–Adie syndrome or Adie's tonic pupil, is a neurological disorder characterized by a tonically dilated pupil that reacts slowly to light but shows a more definite response to accommodation (i.e., light-near dissociation).[1] It is frequently seen in females with absent knee or ankle jerks and impaired sweating. It is named after the British neurologist William John Adie. It is caused by damage to the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathethethetic innervation of the eye, usually by a viral or bacterial infection which causes inflammation, and affects the pupil of the eye and the autonomic nervous system.[1]
Adiposis dolorosa, also known as Dercum's disease[1] or Anders disease, is a rare condition characterized by generalized obesity and fatty tumors in the adipose tissue. The tumors are normally painful and found in multiples on the extremities.[2] The cause and mechanism of Dercum's disease remains unknown.[3] Possible causes include nervous system dysfunction, mechanical pressure on nerves, adipose tissue dysfunction, and trauma.[4]
Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones, primarily cortisol; but may also include impaired production of aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid), which regulates sodium conservation, potassium secretion, and water retention.[1][2] Craving for salt or salty foods due to the urinary losses of sodium is common.[3]
Adrenocortical carcinoma, also adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) and adrenal cortex cancer, is an aggressive cancer originating in the cortex (steroid hormone-producing tissue) of the adrenal gland. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor, with incidence of 1–2 per million population annually.[1][2] Adrenocortical carcinoma has a bimodal distribution by age, with cases clustering in children under 5, and in adults 30–40 years old.[1] Adrenocortical carcinoma is remarkable for the many hormonal syndromes which can occur in patients with steroid hormone-producing ("functional") tumors, including Cushing's syndrome, Conn syndrome, virilization, and feminization. Adrenocortical carcinoma has often invaded nearby tissues or metastasized to distant organs at the time of diagnosis, and the overall 5-year survival rate is only 20–35%.[1] The widely used angiotensin-II-responsive steroid-producing cell line H295R was originally isolated from a tumor diagnosed as adrenocortical carcinoma.[3][4]
Adrenoleukodystrophy (/-ˌlu-koʊ-ˈdis-trə-fiː/; also known as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, ALD, X-ALD, Siemerling–Creutzfeldt disease or bronze Schilder disease) is a disease linked to the X chromosome. It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by the relevant enzymes not functioning properly, which then causes damage to the myelin sheathes of the nerves, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other side effects include problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions.
Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (also referred to as adult ADHD or simply ADHD in adults, formerly AADD) is the neurobiological condition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults.
Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of persistent high spiking fevers, joint pain, and a distinctive salmon-colored bumpy rash. The disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.[1] Levels of the iron-binding protein ferritin may be elevated with this disorder. AOSD may present in a similar manner to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases, which must be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Prognosis is usually favorable but manifestations of the disease affecting the lungs, heart, or kidney may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications.[2] It is treated first with steroids such as prednisone. Drugs that block the action of interleukin-1, particularly IL-1β, are effective treatments.[citation needed]
Aerosinusitis, also called barosinusitis, sinus squeeze or sinus barotrauma is a painful inflammation and sometimes bleeding of the membrane of the paranasal sinus cavities, normally the frontal sinus. It is caused by a difference in air pressures inside and outside the cavities.[1][2][3][4][5]
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness,[1] is a parasitic disease of humans and other animals. It is caused by protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei.[2] There are two types that infect humans, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b.g) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T.b.r.).[1] T.b.g causes over 98% of reported cases.[1] Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas.[1]
Senescence (/sɪˈnɛsəns/) (from Latin: senescere, meaning "to grow old," from senex) or biological aging (also spelled biological ageing) is the gradual deterioration of function characteristic of most complex lifeforms, arguably found in all biological kingdoms, that on the level of the organism increases mortality after maturation. The word "senescence" can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism. It is commonly believed that cellular senescence underlies organismal senescence. The science of biological aging is biogerontology.
Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare condition marked by the presence of desmoid tumors. Desmoid tumors can arise in virtually any part of the body, and are tumors that arise from cells called fibroblasts, which are found throughout the body and provide structural support, protection to the vital organs, and play a critical role in wound healing. These tumors tend to occur in women in their thirties, but can occur in anyone at any age. They can be either relatively slow-growing or malignant. However, aggressive fibromatosis is locally aggressive. When they are aggressive they can cause life-threatening problems or even death when they compress vital organs such as intestines, kidney, lungs, blood vessels, nerves etc. Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with Gardner's syndrome, a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.[1]
Agnathia (also termed hypognathous)[1] is absence of a portion or the entirety of one or both jaws.[1][2] It is a very rare condition.[1]
Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away.[1] These situations can include open spaces, public transit, shopping malls, or simply being outside the home.[1] Being in these situations may result in a panic attack.[2] The symptoms occur nearly every time the situation is encountered and lasts for more than six months. Those affected will go to great lengths to avoid these situations.[1] In severe cases people may become unable to leave their homes.[2]
Agraphia is an acquired neurological disorder causing a loss in the ability to communicate through writing, either due to some form of motor dysfunction[1] or an inability to spell.[2] The loss of writing ability may present with other language or neurological disorders;[1] disorders appearing commonly with agraphia are alexia, aphasia, dysarthria, agnosia, and apraxia.[1][3] The study of individuals with agraphia may provide more information about the pathways involved in writing, both language related and motoric.[3] Agraphia cannot be directly treated, but individuals can learn techniques to help regain and rehabilitate some of their previous writing abilities. These techniques differ depending on the type of agraphia.
Aicardi syndrome is a rare genetic malformation syndrome characterized by the partial or complete absence of a key structure in the brain called the corpus callosum, the presence of retinal abnormalities, and seizures in the form of infantile spasms. Aicardi syndrome is theorized to be caused by a defect on the X chromosome as it has thus far only been observed in girls or in boys with Klinefelter syndrome. Confirmation of this theory awaits the discovery of a causative gene. Symptoms typically appear before a baby reaches about 5 months of age.[citation needed]
Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS), which is completely distinct from the similarly named Aicardi syndrome, is a rare, usually early onset childhood, inflammatory disorder most typically affecting the brain and the skin (neurodevelopmental disorder).[1][2] The majority of affected individuals experience significant intellectual and physical problems, although this is not always the case. The clinical features of AGS can mimic those of in utero acquired infection, and some characteristics of the condition also overlap with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).[3][4][5] Following an original description of eight cases in 1984,[1] the condition was first referred to as 'Aicardi–Goutières syndrome' (AGS) in 1992,[6] and the first international meeting on AGS was held in Pavia, Italy, in 2001.[7]
Aichmophobia (pronounced [īk-mō-fō′bē-ă]) is a kind of specific phobia, the morbid fear of sharp things,[1] such as pencils, needles, knives, a pointing finger, or even the sharp end of an umbrella and different sorts of protruding corners or sharp edges in furnitures and building constructions/materials. It is derived from the Greek aichmē (point) and phobos (fear). This fear may also be referred to as belonephobia or enetophobia.
AIDS dysmorphic syndrome, also called HIV embryopathy, is a cluster of facial malformations seen in children with perinatal HIV infection. Its status as a syndrome is disputed by the research community. Common symptoms of perinatal HIV infection include candidiasis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.[1]
Ainhum (from Portuguese, pronounced īn-yoom´, i´num or ān´hum;[1] also known as dactylolysis spontanea[2]) is a painful constriction of the base of the fifth toe frequently followed by bilateral spontaneous autoamputation a few years later.
Albinism in humans is a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.[3]
Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy is a form of osteodystrophy,[1] otherwise known as pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a.
Alcohol dependence is a previous psychiatric diagnosis in which an individual is physically or psychologically dependent upon drinking alcohol. In 2013 it was reclassified as alcohol use disorder (alcoholism) along with alcohol abuse in DSM-5.[1]
Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a set of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, seeing or hearing things that others do not, and delirium tremens (DTs).[1] Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink, are worst at 24 to 72 hours, and improve by seven days.[2][3]
Alcoholic hepatitis is hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) due to excessive intake of alcohol.[1] It is usually found in association with fatty liver, an early stage of alcoholic liver disease, and may contribute to the progression of fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis. Signs and symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis include jaundice, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), fatigue and hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure). Mild cases are self-limiting, but severe cases have a high risk of death. Severe cases may be treated with glucocorticoids.
Aldolase A deficiency, also called ALDOA deficiency or red cell aldolase deficiency,[1] is an autosomal recessive[2] metabolic disorder resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase A, which is found predominantly in red blood cells and muscle tissue. It may lead to hemolytic anaemia as well as myopathy associated with exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis in some cases.
Alexander disease, also known as fibrinoid leukodystrophy, is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. It is a rare genetic disorder and mostly affects infants and children, causing developmental delay and changes in physical characteristics.[1][2][3]
Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a condition in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without control over the actions.[1] The term is used for a variety of clinical conditions and most commonly affects the left hand.[2] There are many similar names used to describe the various forms of the condition but they are often used inappropriately.[3] The afflicted person may sometimes reach for objects and manipulate them without wanting to do so, even to the point of having to use the controllable hand to restrain the alien hand.[4] While under normal circumstances, thought, as intent, and action can be assumed to be deeply mutually entangled, the occurrence of alien hand syndrome can be usefully conceptualized as a phenomenon reflecting a functional "disentanglement" between thought and action.[citation needed]
Alkaptonuria (black urine disease, black bone disease, or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder in which the body cannot process the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which occur in protein. It is caused by a mutation in the HGD gene for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5); if a person inherits abnormal copies from each parent (it is a recessive condition) the body accumulates an intermediate substance called homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form alkapton are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over thirty years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.
Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome is a rare X-linked inherited disorder of brain development that causes moderate to severe intellectual disability and problems with movement. This condition, which occurs almost exclusively in males, disrupts development from before birth.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a condition characterised by an exaggerated response of the immune system (a hypersensitivity response) to the fungus Aspergillus (most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus). It occurs most often in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Aspergillus spores are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in the sputum of healthy individuals. A. fumigatus is responsible for a spectrum of lung diseases known as aspergilloses.
Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is an autoimmune disease in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp due to the body's failure to recognize its own body cells and subsequent destruction of its own tissue.[1][2] Often it results in bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages. In 1–2% of cases, the condition can spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or to the entire skin (alopecia universalis).
Alopecia contractures dwarfism mental retardation or ACD mental retardation syndrome is a developmental disorder which causes mainly baldness and dwarfism in combination with intellectual disability; skeletal anomalies, caries and nearsightedness are also typical.[1]
Alopecia totalis is the loss of all skull and facial hair. Its causes are unclear, but believed to be autoimmune.
Alopecia universalis (AU) or alopecia areata universalis is a medical condition involving loss of all hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. It is an advanced form of alopecia areata.[1]
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (α1-antitrypsin deficiency, A1AD) is a genetic disorder that causes defective production of alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT), leading to decreased A1AT activity in the blood and lungs, and deposition of excessive abnormal A1AT protein in liver cells.[1][2] There are several forms and degrees of deficiency; the form and degree depend on whether the sufferer has one or two copies of a defective allele. In the literature it has been described as either a recessive or co-dominant trait as there is some evidence that smoking heterozygotes are affected.[3] Severe A1AT deficiency causes panacinar emphysema or COPD in adult life in many people with the condition (especially if they are exposed to cigarette smoke).[4] The disorder can lead to various liver diseases in a minority of children and adults, and occasionally more unusual problems.[4] It is treated through avoidance of damaging inhalants and, in severe cases, by intravenous infusions of the A1AT protein or by transplantation of the liver or lungs. It usually produces some degree of disability and reduces life expectancy.[1]
Alpha-mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder[1] caused by deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-D-mannosidase. In humans it is known to be caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation.[2] In livestock it is caused by chronic poisoning with swainsonine from locoweed.
Alpha-thalassemia (α-thalassemia, α-thalassaemia) is a form of thalassemia involving the genes HBA1[1] and HBA2.[2] Alpha-thalassemia is due to impaired production of alpha chains from 1,2,3, or all 4 of the alpha globin genes, leading to a relative excess of beta globin chains. The degree of impairment is based on which clinical phenotype is present (how many genes are affected).[3][4]
Alpha Thalassemia- Abnormal Morphogensis is a group of blood disorders that affect the way the body makes hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. It's made up of alpha globin and beta globin. Normally each person has four genes for alpha globin, Alpha thalassemia happens when one or more of the genes that control the making of alpha globin is absent or defective.[1] It can cause anemia ranging from mild to severe. Also causing Genital abnormalities and terminal transverse limb defectiveness which is why it is called abnormal morphogenesis. This is most commonly found in people of African, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Southeast Asian and occasionally, Mediterranean descent.
Alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome (ATRX), also called alpha-thalassemia X-linked mental retardation, nondeletion type or ATR-X syndrome,[1] is a condition caused by a mutated gene. Females with this mutated gene have no specific signs or features, but may demonstrate skewed X chromosome inactivation. Hemizygous males tend to be moderately intellectually disabled and have physical characteristics including coarse facial features, microcephaly (small head size), hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), a depressed nasal bridge, a tented upper lip, and an everted lower lip.[2] Mild or moderate anemia, associated with alpha-thalassemia, is part of the condition.[3]
Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder[1] affecting around 1 in 50,000 children, characterized by glomerulonephritis, end-stage kidney disease, and hearing loss.[2] Alport syndrome can also affect the eyes, though the changes do not usually affect sight, except when changes to the lens occur in later life. Blood in urine is universal. Proteinuria is a feature as kidney disease progresses.
Alternating hemiplegia refers to a form of hemiplegia that has an ipsilateral and contralateral presentation in different parts of the body. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body.[1] There are multiple forms of alternating hemiplegia, Weber's syndrome, middle alternating hemiplegia, and inferior alternating hemiplegia. This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis. With a lesion in the brainstem, this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem. The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion. Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor), VI (Abducens), and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract, the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord. Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days, many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of alternating hemiplegia are mental impairment, gait and balance difficulties, excessive sweating and changes in body temperature.[1]
Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare neurological disorder of uncertain etiology,[1] though growing evidence strongly supports mutation of the ATP1A3 gene as the primary cause of this disease.[2][3] AHC is named for the transient episodes, often referred to as attacks or episodes, of hemiplegia from which those with the disorder suffer. These hemiplegic attacks can cause anything from mild weakness to complete paralysis on one or both sides of the body, and they can vary greatly in duration. Attacks may also alternate from one side of the body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. AHC is associated with many symptoms besides hemiplegia, and the majority of these become apparent in early infancy. AHC typically presents before the age of 18 months. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking.[4] The disorder was only recently discovered, having first been characterized in 1971.[1][5] AHC is also extremely rare – approximately 1 in 1,000,000 people have this disorder. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Much of the literature about AHC is purposefully vague in this respect due to a lack of information on the disorder.[4]
Alveolar capillary dysplasia (ACD, sometimes denoted ACDMPV when including misalignment of the pulmonary veins) is a type of diffuse developmental disorder of the lung. The other two diffuse developmental disorders are congenital acinar dysplasia and congenital alveolar dysplasia (CAD).
Alveolar soft part sarcoma, abbreviated ASPS, is a very rare type of soft-tissue sarcoma, that grows slowly and whose cell of origin is unknown.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as just Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and gets worse over time.[1][2] It is the cause of 60% to 70% of cases of dementia.[1][2] The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss).[1] As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues.[1][2] As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society.[1] Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death.[3] Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.[4][5]
Early-onset Alzheimer's disease, also called early-onset Alzheimer's, or early-onset AD, is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed before the age of 65. It is an uncommon form of Alzheimer's, accounting for only 5-10% of all Alzheimer's cases. Approximately 13% of the cases of early-onset Alzheimer's are familial Alzheimer's disease,[1] where a genetic predisposition leads to the disease. The other incidences of early onset Alzheimer's, however, share the same traits as the 'late onset' form of Alzheimer's disease, and little is understood about how it starts.
Amaurosis (Greek meaning darkening, dark, or obscure) is vision loss or weakness that occurs without an apparent lesion affecting the eye.[1] It may result from either a medical condition or from excess acceleration, as in flight. The term is the same as the Latin gutta serena.
Amblyopia, also called lazy eye, is a disorder of sight due to the eye and brain not working well together. It results in decreased vision in an eye that otherwise typically appears normal. It is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults.[1]
Amelia (from Greek ἀ- "lack of" plus μέλος (plural: μέλεα or μέλη) "limb") is the birth defect of lacking one or more limbs. It can also result in a shrunken or deformed limb. For example, a child might be born without an elbow or forearm. The term may be modified to indicate the number of legs or arms missing at birth, such as tetra-amelia for the absence of all four limbs. A related term is meromelia, which is the partial absence of a limb or limbs.[1]
Amelogenesis is the formation of enamel on teeth and begins when the crown is forming during the advanced bell stage of tooth development after dentinogenesis, forms a first layer of dentine. Although dentin must be present for enamel to be formed, ameloblasts must also be for dentinogenesis to continue. A message is sent from the newly differentiated odontoblasts to the inner enamel epithelium (IEE), causing the epithelial cells to further differentiate into active secretory ameloblasts. Dentinogenesis is in turn dependent on signals from the differentiating IEE in order for the process to continue. This prerequisite is an example of the biological concept known as reciprocal induction, in this instance between mesenchymal and epithelial cells.
Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) presents with a rare abnormal formation of the enamel[1] or external layer of the crown of teeth. Enamel is composed mostly of mineral, that is formed and regulated by the proteins in it. Amelogenesis imperfecta is due to the malfunction of the proteins in the enamel: ameloblastin, enamelin, tuftelin and amelogenin.
Amnesia (from Greek, meaning "forgetfulness"; from ἀ- (a-), meaning "without", and μνήσις (mnesis), meaning "memory"), also known as amnesic syndrome, is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage, disease, or psychological trauma.[1] Amnesia can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs. The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.[2] There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.[3] In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive. Both can occur within a patient at one time. Case studies, such as that of patient R.B., show that both types of amnesia can occur simultaneously.
Anterograde amnesia is a loss of the ability to create new memories after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, anterograde amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.
Childhood amnesia, also called infantile amnesia, is the inability of adults to retrieve episodic memories which are memories of specific events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, and where) before the age of 2–4 years, as well as the period before age 10 of which adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time.[1] The development of a cognitive self is also thought by some to have an effect on encoding and storing early memories.[2] Some research has demonstrated that children can remember events from the age of 1, but that these memories may decline as children get older.[3][4][5] Most psychologists differ in defining the offset of childhood amnesia. Some define it as the age from which a first memory can be retrieved. This is usually at the age of 3 or 4, but it can range from 2 to 8 years.[6][7][8] Changes in encoding, storage and retrieval of memories during early childhood are all important when considering childhood amnesia.[9] Some other research shows differences between gender and culture, which is implicated in the development of language. Childhood amnesia is particularly important to consider in regard to false memories and the development of the brain in early years. Proposed explanations of childhood amnesia are Freud's trauma theory (which is not supported by evidence and is generally discredited), neurological development, development of the cognitive self, emotion and language.
Drug-induced amnesia is amnesia caused by drugs. Amnesia may be therapeutic for medical treatment or for medical procedures, or it may be a side-effect of a drug, such as alcohol, or certain medications for psychiatric disorders, such as benzodiazepines.[1]
Lacunar amnesia is the loss of memory about one specific event. It is a type of amnesia that leaves a lacuna (a gap) in the record of memory in the cortex region of the brain. The cause of this type of amnesia is the result of brain damage to the limbic system which control our memories and emotions.
Psychogenic amnesia, also known as dissociative amnesia, is a memory disorder characterized by sudden retrograde autobiographical memory loss, said to occur for a period of time ranging from hours to years.[1] More recently, "dissociative amnesia" has been defined as a dissociative disorder "characterized by retrospectively reported memory gaps. These gaps involve an inability to recall personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature."[2] In a change from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5, dissociative fugue is now subsumed under dissociative amnesia.[3]
Retrograde amnesia (RA) is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred, or information that was learned, before an injury or the onset of a disease.[1] It tends to negatively affect episodic, autobiographical, and declarative memory while usually keeping procedural memory intact with no difficulty for learning new knowledge. RA can be temporally graded or more permanent based on the severity of its cause and is usually consistent with Ribot's Law: where subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more remote memories.[2] The type of information that is forgotten can be very specific, like a single event, or more general, resembling generic amnesia. It is not to be confused with anterograde amnesia, which deals with the inability to form new memories following the onset of an injury or disease.
Source amnesia is the inability to remember where, when or how previously learned information has been acquired, while retaining the factual knowledge.[1] This branch of amnesia is associated with the malfunctioning of one's explicit memory. It is likely that the disconnect between having the knowledge and remembering the context in which the knowledge was acquired is due to a dissociation between semantic and episodic memory[2] – an individual retains the semantic knowledge (the fact), but lacks the episodic knowledge to indicate the context in which the knowledge was gained.
Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a neurological disorder whose key defining characteristic is a temporary but almost total disruption of short-term memory with a range of problems accessing older memories. A person in a state of TGA exhibits no other signs of impaired cognitive functioning but recalls only the last few moments of consciousness, as well as deeply encoded facts of the individual's past, such as his or her own name.[1][2]
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease and motor neurone disease (MND), is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles.[1][2][3] Some also use the term "motor neuron disease" for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common.[4] ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size.[4] This results in difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing.[2][4]
Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.[1][2] It typically causes more than one of the following: an itchy rash, throat or tongue swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, and low blood pressure. These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours.[3]
Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by a rickettsial parasite of ruminants, Anaplasma spp. The microorganism is gram-negative[1] and occurs in the red blood cells. It is transmitted by natural means through a number of haematophagous species of ticks. Anaplasmosis can also be transmitted by the use of surgical, dehorning, castration, and tattoo instruments and hypodermic needles that are not disinfected between uses.
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a form of thyroid cancer which has a very poor prognosis due to its aggressive behavior and resistance to cancer treatments.[1] Its anaplastic cells have poor differentiation, including dedifferentiation.
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of the cell to respond to androgens.[1][2][3] The unresponsiveness of the cell to the presence of androgenic hormones can impair or prevent the masculinization of male genitalia in the developing fetus, as well as the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty, but does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development.[3][4] As such, the insensitivity to androgens is clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene).[1] Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.[1][5][6][7][8][9]
Anemia, also spelled anaemia, is usually defined as a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood.[1][2] It can also be defined as a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen.[3] When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath or a poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms, which may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss of consciousness, or increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause.[4]
Anencephaly is the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp that occurs during embryonic development.[1] It is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the rostral (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th day following conception.[2] Strictly speaking, the Greek term translates as "no in-head" (that is, totally lacking the inside part of the head, i.e. the brain), but it is accepted that children born with this disorder usually only lack a telencephalon,[3] the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres, including the neocortex, which is responsible for cognition. The remaining structure is usually covered only by a thin layer of membrane— skin, bone, meninges, etc. are all lacking.[4] With very few exceptions,[5][6] infants with this disorder do not survive longer than a few hours or possibly days after their birth.
Aneurysm of the aortic sinus, also known as the sinus of Valsalva, is comparatively rare. When present, it is usually in either the right (65–85%) or in the noncoronary (10–30%) sinus, rarely in the left (< 5%) sinus.[1]
An aneurysm is a localized, blood-filled balloon-like bulge in the wall of a blood vessel.[1] Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel, with particularly lethal examples including aneurysms of the Circle of Willis in the brain, aortic aneurysms affecting the thoracic aorta, and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms can arise in the heart itself following a heart attack, including both ventricular and atrial septal aneurysms.
Angiolipoma is a subcutaneous nodule with vascular structure, having all other features of a typical lipoma. They are commonly painful.[1]:624[2]
Angiomas are benign tumors derived from cells of the vascular or lymphatic vessel walls (endothelium) or derived from cells of the tissues surrounding these vessels.[1][2]
Angiomatosis is a non-neoplastic condition[1] presenting with little knots of capillaries in various organs. It consists of many angiomas.[2] It is associated with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease and is a rare genetic multi system disorder characterized by the abnormal growth of tumours in the body. Symptoms may include headaches, problems with balance and walking, dizziness, weakness of the limbs, vision problems and high blood pressure. Prognosis depends on the size and location of the tumour, untreated angiomatosis may lead to blindness and/ or permanent brain damage. Death may occur, with complications in the kidney or brain.[3]
Angiosarcoma is a cancer of the cells that line the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. The lining of the vessel walls is called the endothelium. Cancers from the walls of blood vessels are called hemangiosarcomas and cancers from the walls of lymphatic vessels are called lymphangiosarcomas.

Angiostrongyliasis is an infection by a nematode from the Angiostrongylus genus of kidney and alimentary tract roundworms. For example, infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis can occur after consuming raw Giant African land snails, great grey slugs, or other mollusks.
Aniridia ataxia renal agenesis psychomotor retardation is a rare genetic disorder characterized by missing irises of the eye, ataxia, psychomotor retardation and abnormal kidneys.[1]
Aniridia is the absence of the iris, usually involving both eyes. It can be congenital or caused by a penetrant injury.[1] Isolated aniridia is a congenital disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development, but is a panocular condition with macular and optic nerve hypoplasia, cataract, and corneal changes.[2] Vision may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently associated with a number of ocular complications: nystagmus, amblyopia, buphthalmos, and cataract.[1] Aniridia in some individuals occurs as part of a syndrome, such as WAGR syndrome (kidney nephroblastoma (Wilms tumour), genitourinary anomalies and intellectual disability), or Gillespie syndrome (cerebellar ataxia).
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis in which there is long term inflammation of the joints of the spine.[2] Typically the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Back pain is a characteristic symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes.[2] Stiffness of the affected joints generally worsens over time.[2][3]
Ankylosis or anchylosis (from Greek ἀγκύλος, bent, crooked) is a stiffness of a joint due to abnormal adhesion and rigidity of the bones of the joint, which may be the result of injury or disease. The rigidity may be complete or partial and may be due to inflammation of the tendinous or muscular structures outside the joint or of the tissues of the joint itself.
Annular pancreas is a rare condition in which the second part of the duodenum is surrounded by a ring of pancreatic tissue continuous with the head of the pancreas. This portion of the pancreas can constrict the duodenum and block or impair the flow of food to the rest of the intestines. It is estimated to occur in 1 out of 12,000 to 15,000 newborns.[1] The ambiguity arises from the fact that not all cases are symptomatic.[2]
Annuloaortic ectasia is a dilation of the proximal ascending aorta and aortic annulus. It may cause aortic regurgitation, thoracic aortic dissection, aneurysm and rupture. It is often associated with Marfan syndrome. It can also be a complication due to tertiary syphilis. In tertiary syphilis the aortic root becomes so dilated that the aortic valve becomes incompetent and cor bovinum results.
In dentistry, anodontia, also called anodontia vera, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the congenital absence of all primary or permanent teeth. It is associated with the group of skin and nerve syndromes called the ectodermal dysplasias. Anodontia is usually part of a syndrome and seldom occurs as an isolated entity.
Anomic aphasia (also known as dysnomia, nominal aphasia, and amnesic aphasia) is a mild, fluent type of aphasia where an individual has word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs).[1] Anomia is a deficit of expressive language. The most pervasive deficit in the aphasias is anomia. Some level of anomia is seen in all of the aphasias.[2] Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object. [3]
Anonychia is the absence of nails, an anomaly, which may be the result of a congenital ectodermal defect, ichthyosis, severe infection, severe allergic contact dermatitis, self-inflicted trauma, Raynaud phenomenon, lichen planus, epidermolysis bullosa, or severe exfoliative diseases.[1]:784
Anophthalmia, (Greek: ανόφθαλμος, "without eye"), is the medical term for the absence of one or both eyes. Both the globe (human eye) and the ocular tissue are missing from the orbit.[1] The absence of the eye will cause a small bony orbit, a constricted mucosal socket, short eyelids, reduced palpebral fissure and malar prominence.[2] Genetic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and prenatal environment can all cause anophthalmia. Anophthalmia is an extremely rare disease and is mostly rooted in genetic abnormalities. It can also be associated with other syndromes.
Anorchia (or anorchism) is an XY disorder of sex development in which individuals have both testes absent at birth. Within a few weeks of fertilization, the embryo develops rudimentary gonads (testes), which produce hormones responsible for the development of the reproductive system. If the testes fail to develop within eight weeks, the baby will develop female genitalia (see Swyer syndrome). If the testes begin to develop but are lost or cease to function between eight and 10 weeks, the baby will have ambiguous genitalia when it is born. However, if the testes are lost after 14 weeks, the baby will have partial male genitalia with the notable absence of gonads.

Anorexia nervosa, often referred to simply as anorexia,[1] is an eating disorder characterized by a low weight, fear of gaining weight, a strong desire to be thin, and food restriction.[2] Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight.[2][3] If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight.[4] Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others.[2] Women will often stop having menstrual periods.[4]
Anorgasmia is a type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm despite adequate stimulation. In males, it is most closely associated with delayed ejaculation. Anorgasmia can often cause sexual frustration. Anorgasmia is far more common in females (4.7 percent)[1] than in males and is especially rare in younger men. The problem is greater in women who are post-menopause.[1]
Anosmia (/ænˈɒzmiə/) is the inability to perceive odor or a lack of functioning olfaction—the loss of the sense of smell. Anosmia may be temporary, but some anosmia (including traumatic anosmia) can be permanent. Anosmia is due to a number of factors, including an inflammation of the nasal mucosa, blockage of nasal passages or a destruction of one temporal lobe. Inflammation is due to chronic mucosa changes in the paranasal sinus lining and the middle and superior turbinates.
Anotia ("no ear") describes a rare congenital deformity that involves the complete absence of the pinna, the outer projected portion of the ear, and narrowing or absence of the ear canal. This contrasts with microtia, in which a small part of the pinna is present. Anotia and microtia may occur unilaterally (only one ear affected) or bilaterally (both ears affected). This deformity results in conductive hearing loss, deafness.
Anterior horn disease is one of a number of medical disorders affecting the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Anterior horn diseases include spinal muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Anterograde amnesia is a loss of the ability to create new memories after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, anterograde amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.
Antiphospholipid syndrome or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS), or often known also as Hughes syndrome in the UK, is an autoimmune, hypercoagulable state caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia.
Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), also known as dissocial personality disorder (DPD) and sociopathy, is a personality disorder, characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others. An impoverished moral sense or conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of crime, legal problems, or impulsive and aggressive behavior.[1][2]
Anti-synthetase syndrome is a rare medical syndrome associated with interstitial lung disease, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis and other autoimmune diseases.[1][2]
Antley–Bixler syndrome, also called trapezoidocephaly-synostosis syndrome,[1] is a rare, very severe autosomal recessive[2] congenital disorder characterized by malformations and deformities affecting the majority of the skeleton and other areas of the body.

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inside of the aorta causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart.[1] In most cases this is associated with a sudden onset of severe chest or back pain, often described as "tearing" in character.[2][3] Also, vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may occur. Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death as a result of not enough blood flow to the heart or rupture of the aorta.[3]
The aortic window is a normally radiolucent region below the aortic arch. It is formed by the bifurcation of the trachea and traversed by the left pulmonary artery. It is visible in the left anterior oblique radiograph of the heart and great vessels.
Apert syndrome is a form of acrocephalosyndactyly, a congenital disorder characterized by malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. It is classified as a branchial arch syndrome, affecting the first branchial (or pharyngeal) arch, the precursor of the maxilla and mandible. Disturbances in the development of the branchial arches in fetal development create lasting and widespread effects.
Aphalangia is a syndrome with the characteristic absence of the phalanx bone on one or more digits[1]
Aphthous stomatitis is a common condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. The informal term canker sores is also used, mainly in North America, although this may also refer to any mouth ulcer.
Aplasia (from Greek a (not, no); plasis (molding) is defined in general as "defective development or congenital absence of an organ or tissue."[1][2] In the field of hematology, the term refers to "incomplete, retarded, or defective development, or cessation of the usual regenerative process."[1][2]
Aplasia cutis congenita (also known as "Cutis aplasia," "Congenital absence of skin," and "Congenital scars"[1]) is the most common congenital cicatricial alopecia, and is a congenital focal absence of epidermis with or without evidence of other layers of the skin.[2][3]
Aplastic anemia is a rare disease in which the bone marrow and the hematopoietic stem cells that reside there are damaged.[1] This causes a deficiency of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia): red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (leukopenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia).[2][3] Aplastic refers to inability of the stem cells to generate mature blood cells.
Roberts syndrome, or sometimes called pseudothalidomide syndrome, is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is characterized by mild to severe prenatal retardation or disruption of cell division, leading to malformation of the bones in the skull, face, arms, and legs.
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms.[2] Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.[3]
Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex), in which the individual has difficulty with the motor planning to perform tasks or movements when asked, provided that the request or command is understood and he/she is willing to perform the task. The nature of the brain damage determines the severity, and the absence of sensory loss or paralysis helps to explain the level of difficulty.[1]
In pathology, an apudoma is an endocrine tumour that arises from an APUD cell[2][3] from structures such as the ampulla of Vater,.[4] They were historically thought to be derived from neural crest cells,[5] but this has since been shown to be untrue (see neuroendocrine tumor).
Aqueductal stenosis is a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius which blocks the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system. Blockage of the aqueduct can lead to hydrocephalus, specifically as a common cause of congenital and/or obstructive hydrocephalus.[1][2]
Arachnodactyly ("spider fingers") or achromachia is a condition in which the fingers and toes are abnormally long and slender, in comparison to the palm of the hand and arch of the foot. Also, the individual's thumbs tend to also be pulled inwards towards the palm.[1] It can be present at birth or develop in later life.[citation needed]
Arachnoiditis is an inflammatory condition of the arachnoid mater or 'arachnoid', one of the membranes known as meninges that surround and protect the nerves of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid can become inflamed because of adverse reactions to chemicals, infection from bacteria or viruses, as the result of direct injury to the spine, chronic compression of spinal nerves, complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures, or the accidental intrathecal injection of steroids intended for the epidural space.[1][2] Inflammation can sometimes lead to the formation of scar tissue and adhesion that can make the spinal nerves "stick" together,[3] a condition where such tissue develops in and between the leptomeninges.[4] The condition can be extremely painful, especially when progressing to adhesive arachnoiditis. Another form of the condition is arachnoiditis ossificans, in which the arachnoid becomes ossified, or turns to bone, and is thought to be a late-stage complication of the adhesive form of arachnoiditis.[5]
Arakawa's syndrome II[1] is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder that causes a deficiency of the enzyme tetrahydrofolate-methyltransferase; affected individuals cannot properly metabolize methylcobalamin, a type of Vitamin B12.
AREDYLD stands for acral renal ectodermal dysplasia lipoatrophic diabetes. AREDLYD is categorized as a rare disease, meaning it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the American population at any given time.
Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) or O'Higgins disease, also known in Argentina as mal de los rastrojos, stubble disease, is a hemorrhagic fever and zoonotic infectious disease occurring in Argentina. It is caused by the Junín virus (an arenavirus, closely related to the Machupo virus, causative agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever). Its vector is a species of rodent, the corn mouse.
Argininosuccinic aciduria, also called argininosuccinic acidemia, is an inherited disorder that causes the accumulation of argininosuccinic acid (also known as "ASA") in the blood and urine. Some patients may also have an elevation of ammonia, a toxic chemical, which can affect the nervous system. Argininosuccinic aciduria may become evident in the first few days of life because of high blood ammonia, or later in life presenting with "sparse" or "brittle" hair, developmental delay, and tremors.
Argyria or argyrosis (from Ancient Greek: ἄργυρος argyros silver) is a condition caused by inappropriate exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver, or to silver dust.[1] The most dramatic symptom of argyria is that the skin turns blue or bluish-grey. It may take the form of generalized argyria or local argyria. Generalized argyria affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body. Local argyria shows in limited regions of the body, such as patches of skin, parts of the mucous membrane or the conjunctiva.
Chiari malformation, Type II is also known as Arnold–Chiari malformation after the surgeons that initially described it, is a malformation of the skull. It consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum (the opening at the base of the skull), sometimes causing non-communicating hydrocephalus[1] as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow.[2] The cerebrospinal fluid outflow is caused by phase difference in outflow and influx of blood in the vasculature of the brain. It can cause headaches, difficulty focusing, concentrating, and thinking, as well as difficulty coping (with what most consider and experience as normal, everyday life), fatigue, muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing (sometimes accompanied by gagging), choking and vomiting, dizziness, nausea, tinnitus, impaired coordination, neck pain, unsteady gait (problems with balance), poor hand coordination (fine motor skills), numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, and speech problems (such as hoarseness).
Aromatase deficiency is a condition resulting from insufficient production of the enzyme aromatase,[1] which can result in inappropriate virilization of female fetuses and delayed puberty, as well as inappropriate virilization of the mother during pregnancy.
Aromatase excess syndrome (AES or AEXS), also sometimes referred to as familial hyperestrogenism or familial gynecomastia, is a rare genetic and endocrine syndrome which is characterized by an overexpression of aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the estrogen sex hormones from the androgens, in turn resulting in excessive levels of circulating estrogens and, accordingly, symptoms of hyperestrogenism. It affects both sexes, manifesting itself in males as marked or complete phenotypical feminization (with the exception of the genitalia; i.e., no pseudohermaphroditism) and in females as hyperfeminization.[1][2][3][4]
Arrhinia (/əˈrɪniə/ or /əˈraɪniə/; also called nasal agenesis) is the congenital partial or complete absence of the nose at birth. It is an extremely rare condition, with few reported cases in the history of modern medicine.[1] It is generally classified as a craniofacial abnormality.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is an inherited heart disease.
Arsenic poisoning is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body.[4] If exposure occurs over a brief period of time symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and watery diarrhea that contains blood. Long-term exposure can result in thickening of the skin, darker skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heart disease, numbness, and cancer.[1]
Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary system. This vascular anomaly is widely known because of its occurrence in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM), but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.
Arteritis is the inflammation of the walls of arteries,[1] usually as a result of infection or autoimmune response. Arteritis, a complex disorder, is still not entirely understood.[2] Arteritis may be distinguished by its different types, based on the organ systems affected by the disease.[2] A complication of arteritis is thrombosis, which can be fatal. Arteritis and phlebitis are forms of vasculitis.
Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.[1] Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness.[1] Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.[1][2] In some types other organs are also affected.[3] Onset can be gradual or sudden.[4]
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), or simply arthrogryposis, describes congenital joint contractures in two or more areas of the body. It derives its name from Greek, literally meaning "curving of joints" (arthron, "joint"; grȳpōsis, late Latin form of late Greek grūpōsis, "hooking").[1] Children born with one or more joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to perform active extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints.[2] AMC has been divided into three groups: amyoplasia, distal arthrogryposis, and syndromic. Amyoplasia is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness.[3] Distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet. Types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group.[3]
Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory and scarring disease affecting the tissue of the lungs. People with the condition may experience severe shortness of breath and are at an increased risk for certain cancers, including lung cancer and, less commonly, mesothelioma.[1] Asbestosis specifically refers to fibrosis within the lung tissue from asbestos, and not scarring around the outside of the lungs.
Ascariasis is a disease caused by the parasitic roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides.[1] Infections have no symptoms in more than 85% of cases, especially if the number of worms is small.[1] Symptoms increase with the number of worms present and may include shortness of breath and fever in the beginning of the disease.[1] These may be followed by symptoms of abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.[1] Children are most commonly affected, and in this age group the infection may also cause poor weight gain, malnutrition, and learning problems.[1][2][3]
Ascher's syndrome, or Laffer-Ascher Syndrome, is a rare disorder first described in 1920.[1] It is characterized by repeated episodes of lip and eyelid edema and occasionally euthyroid goiter. The syndrome generally occurs within the first 20 years of life.[2] About 100 cases had been described by 1998.[3]
Aseptic meningitis, or sterile meningitis, is a condition in which the layers lining the brain, the meninges, become inflamed and a pyogenic bacterial source is not to blame. Meningitis is diagnosed on a history of characteristic symptoms and certain examination findings (e.g., Kernig's sign). Investigations should show an increase in the number of leukocytes present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained via lumbar puncture (normally being fewer than five visible leukocytes per microscopic high-power field).
Asherman syndrome (AS) or Fritsch syndrome, is a condition characterized by adhesions and/or fibrosis of the endometrium particularly but can also affect the myometrium. It is often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity.[1] A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including: intrauterine adhesions (IUA), uterine/cervical atresia, traumatic uterine atrophy, sclerotic endometrium, endometrial sclerosis, and intrauterine synechiae.[2]
Ashman phenomenon, also known as Ashman beats, describes a particular type of wide QRS complex, often seen isolated that is typically seen in atrial fibrillation. It is more often misinterpreted as a premature ventricular complex.
Aspergillosis is the name given to a wide variety of diseases caused by infection by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. The majority of cases occur in people with underlying illnesses such as tuberculosis[1] or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but with otherwise healthy immune systems.[2] Most commonly, aspergillosis occurs in the form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).[3] Some forms are intertwined; for example ABPA and simple aspergilloma can progress to CPA.
Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.[1] As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence.[2] Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.[3][4] Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.[1]
Aspiration pneumonia is bronchopneumonia that develops due to the entrance of foreign materials into the bronchial tree,[1] usually oral or gastric contents (including food, saliva, or nasal secretions). Depending on the acidity of the aspirate, a chemical pneumonitis can develop, and bacterial pathogens (particularly anaerobic bacteria) may add to the inflammation.
Asplenia refers to the absence of normal spleen function and is associated with some serious infection risks. Hyposplenism is used to describe reduced ('hypo-') splenic functioning, but not as severely affected as with asplenism.
"Astasia" redirects here. This term was also applied to chlorophyll-less Euglena.
Astasia-abasia refers to the inability to either stand or walk in a normal manner. Astasia refers to the inability to stand upright unassisted. Abasia refers to lack of motor coordination in walking. The term abasia literally means that the base of gait (the lateral distance between the two feet) is inconstant or unmeasurable. When seen in conversion disorder, the gait is bizarre and is not suggestive of a specific organic lesion: often the patient sways wildly and nearly falls, recovering at the last moment.
Asthma is a common long term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.[2] It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm.[3] Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[4] These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person they may become worse at night or with exercise.[2]
Astigmatism is a type of refractive error in which the eye does not focus light evenly on the retina.[1] This results in distorted or blurred vision at all distances. Other symptoms can include eyestrain, headaches, and trouble driving at night.[1] If it occurs early in life it can result in amblyopia.[2]
Astrocytomas are a type of cancer of the brain. They originate in a particular kind of glial cells, star-shaped brain cells in the cerebrum called astrocytes. This type of tumor does not usually spread outside the brain and spinal cord and it does not usually affect other organs. Astrocytomas are the most common glioma and can occur in most parts of the brain and occasionally in the spinal cord. Within the astrocytomas, there are two broad classes recognized in literature, those with:
Genus: Avastrovirus
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which a portion of the myocardium (heart muscle) is hypertrophic (enlarged) without any obvious cause, creating functional impairment of the heart.[2][3][4] It is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.[5] The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in any age group and a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.[6] In most patients, HCM is associated with little or no disability and normal life expectancy.[2]
Ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality. Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom.[1] The word is from Greek α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = "lack of order".
Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It may affect part or all of a lung.[1] It is usually not bilateral. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to pneumothorax.[2]
Atelosteogenesis, type II is a severe disorder of cartilage and bone development. It is extremely rare, and infants with the disorder are usually stillborn; however, those who survive birth die soon after from respiratory failure.
Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a specific form of arteriosclerosis in which an artery-wall thickens as a result of invasion and accumulation of white blood cells (WBCs) (foam cell) and proliferation of intimal-smooth-muscle cell creating an atheromatous (fibrofatty) plaque.[1]
Athetosis is a symptom characterized by slow, involuntary, convoluted, writhing movements of the fingers, hands, toes, and feet and in some cases, arms, legs, neck and tongue.[1] Movements typical of athetosis are sometimes called athetoid movements. Lesions to the brain are most often the direct cause of the symptoms, particularly to the corpus striatum.[2] This symptom does not occur alone and is often accompanied by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often a result of this disease. Treatments for athetosis are not very effective, and in most cases are simply aimed at the uncontrollable movement, rather than the cause itself.
Athlete's foot, known medically as tinea pedis, is a common skin infection of the feet caused by fungus.[2] Signs and symptoms often include itching, scaling, and redness.[3] In severe cases the skin may blister.[4] Athlete's foot fungus may infect any part of the foot, but most often grows between the toes.[3] The next most common area is the bottom of the foot.[4] The same fungus may also affect the nails or the hands.[5] It is a member of the group of diseases known as tinea.[6]
Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a type of inflammation of the skin (dermatitis). It results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Clear fluid may come from the affected areas, which often thicken over time.[1] The condition typically starts in childhood with changing severity over the years.[1][2] In children under one year of age much of the body may be affected. As people get older, the back of the knees and front of the elbows are the most common areas affected. In adults the hands and feet are the most commonly affected areas.[2] Scratching worsens symptoms and affected people have an increased risk of skin infections. Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma.[1]
Atresia is a condition in which an orifice or passage in the body is (usually abnormally) closed or absent.
Intestinal atresia is a malformation where there is a narrowing or absence of a portion of the intestine. This defect can either occur in the small or large intestine.
Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect in which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart. Normally, the atria are separated by a dividing wall, the interatrial septum. If this septum is defective or absent, then oxygen-rich blood can flow directly from the left side of the heart to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart, or vice versa.[1] This can lead to lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small.[2]
An atrioventricular fistula is a fistula between an atrium and a ventricle of the heart.
Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) or atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD), previously known as "common atrioventricular canal" (CAVC) or "endocardial cushion defect", is characterized by a deficiency of the atrioventricular septum of the heart. It is caused by an abnormal or inadequate fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions with the mid portion of the atrial septum and the muscular portion of the ventricular septum.
Atrophic vaginitis (also known as vaginal atrophy, vulvovaginal atrophy, or urogenital atrophy) is an inflammation of the vagina (and the outer urinary tract) due to the thinning and shrinking of the tissues, as well as decreased lubrication. These symptoms are due to a lack of the reproductive hormone estrogen.
Atrophoderma refers to conditions involving skin atrophy.[1]
Atrophy is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body. Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor circulation, loss of hormonal support, loss of nerve supply to the target organ, excessive amount of apoptosis of cells, and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have trophic effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as atrophy.
ATR-16 syndrome, also called Alpha-Thalassemia-Intellectual disability syndrome is a rare disease characterized by monosomy on part of chromosome 16.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type.[1][2] It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age.[3][4] These symptoms begin by age six to twelve, are present for more than six months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities).[5][6] In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance.[3] Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.[7]
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome[1]) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are confined to the colon wall and removal can greatly reduce the spread of cancer.
Lipodystrophy is a medical condition characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body's adipose tissue. ("Lipo" is Greek for "fat", and "dystrophy" is Greek for "abnormal or degenerative condition".) A more specific term, lipoatrophy, is used when describing the loss of fat from one area (usually the face). This condition is also characterized by a lack of circulating leptin which may lead to osteosclerosis.
Auditory processing disorder (APD), also known as central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information.[1] Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the central nervous system.
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[1] These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress.[2] The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.[3]
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia; AIHA) occurs when antibodies directed against the person's own red blood cells (RBCs) cause them to burst (lyse), leading to insufficient plasma concentration. The lifetime of the RBCs is reduced from the normal 100–120 days to just a few days in serious cases.[1][2] The intracellular components of the RBCs are released into the circulating blood and into tissues, leading to some of the characteristic symptoms of this condition. The antibodies are usually directed against high-incidence antigens, therefore they also commonly act on allogenic RBCs (RBCs originating from outside the person themselves, e.g. in the case of a blood transfusion)[3] AIHA is a relatively rare condition, affecting one to three people per 100,000 per year.[4]
Autoimmune hepatitis, formerly called lupoid hepatitis, is a chronic, autoimmune disease of the liver that occurs when the body's immune system attacks liver cells causing the liver to be inflamed. Common initial symptoms include fatigue or muscle aches or signs of acute liver inflammation including fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Individuals with autoimmune hepatitis often have no initial symptoms and the disease is detected by abnormal liver function tests.[1]
Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is a Cluster C personality disorder.[1] Those affected display a pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interaction despite a strong desire to be close to others.[2] Individuals with the disorder tend to describe themselves as uneasy, anxious, lonely, unwanted and isolated from others.[3] The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.[4]
Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium. The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone mineralization. Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term "osteomalacia" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones. In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions necessary for bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides) occurs in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, likely contributing locally to cause matrix hypomineralization (osteomalacia).[1][2][3][4][5]
Osteosclerosis is a type of osteopetrosis that involves abnormal hardening of bone[1] and an elevation in bone density.[2] It can be a pathology, normally detected on a radiograph as an area of increased opacity; that is, where more mineral is present in the bone to absorb or deflect the X-ray beam. Localized osteosclerosis can be caused by injuries that compress the bone, by osteoarthritis, and osteoma.
Ayazi syndrome (or Chromosome 21 Xq21 deletion syndrome)[1] is a syndrome characterized by choroideremia, congenital deafness and obesity.
Babesiosis is a malaria-like parasitic disease caused by infection with Babesia, a genus of Apicomplexa.[1] Human babesiosis is an uncommon but emerging disease in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe, and sporadic throughout the rest of the world. It occurs in warm weather.[2] Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease.[3] After trypanosomes, Babesia is thought to be the second-most common blood parasite of mammals, and they can have a major impact on health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. In cattle, a major host, the disease is known as Texas cattle fever, redwater, or piroplasmosis.[4]
Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic, motile, beta hemolytic bacterium commonly found in soil and food. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne illness, while other strains can be beneficial as probiotics for animals.[1][2] It is the cause of "fried rice syndrome", as the bacteria are classically contracted from fried rice dishes that have been sitting at room temperature for hours.[3][4] B. cereus bacteria are facultative anaerobes, and like other members of the genus Bacillus, can produce protective endospores. Its virulence factors include cereolysin and phospholipase C.
Bacterial pneumonia is a type of pneumonia caused by bacterial infection.[1]
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a disease of the vagina caused by excessive growth of bacteria.[2][3] Common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur.[4] Itching is uncommon.[2][4] Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.[4] Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.[5][6] It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.[7][8]
Balantidiasis is a protozoan infection caused by infection with Balantidium coli.[1]
Bangstad syndrome is a severe, inherited congenital disorder associated with abnormalities of the cell membrane.
Banti's syndrome (also known as Banti's disease) is a chronic congestive enlargement of the spleen[1] resulting in premature destruction of the red blood cells by the spleen. It is named for Guido Banti.[2]
Barbiturate dependence develops with regular use of barbiturates. This in turn may lead to a need for increasing doses of the drug to get the original desired pharmacological or therapeutic effect.[1] Barbiturate use can lead to both addiction and physical dependence, and as such they have a high potential for abuse.[2] Psychological addiction to barbiturates can develop quickly. The GABAA receptor, one of barbiturates' main sites of action, is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of tolerance to and dependence on barbiturates, as well as the euphoric "high" that results from their abuse.[2] The mechanism by which barbiturate tolerance develops is believed to be different from that of ethanol or benzodiazepines, even though these drugs have been shown to exhibit cross-tolerance with each other.[3] The management of a physical dependence on barbiturates is stabilisation on the long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital followed by a gradual titration down of dose. The slowly eliminated phenobarbital lessens the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and reduces the chances of serious barbiturate withdrawal effects such as seizures.[4] Antipsychotics are not recommended for barbiturate withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.[5]
Barbiturate overdose is poisoning due to excessive doses of barbiturates.[8] Symptoms typically include difficulty thinking, poor coordination, decreased level of consciousness, and a decreased effort to breathe (respiratory depression).[1] Complications of overdose can include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.[2] If death occurs this is typically due to a lack of breathing.[3]
Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathic human genetic disorder that produces many effects and affects many body systems. It is characterized principally by obesity, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, hypogonadism, and renal failure in some cases.[1] Historically, slower mental processing has also been considered a principal symptom but is now not regarded as such.
The bare lymphocyte syndrome, type II (BLS II) is a rare recessive genetic condition in which a group of genes called major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) are not expressed. The result is that the immune system is severely compromised and cannot effectively fight infection. Clinically, this is known as a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
Bare lymphocyte syndrome is a condition caused by mutations in certain genes of the major histocompatibility complex or involved with the processing and presentation of MHC molecules. It is a form of severe combined immunodeficiency.[1]
Baritosis is a benign type of pneumoconiosis, which is caused by long-term exposure to barium dust.
Barth syndrome (BTHS), also known as 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type II, is an X-linked[1] genetic disorder. The disorder, which affects multiple body systems, is diagnosed almost exclusively in males. It is named after Dutch pediatric neurologist Peter Barth.
Bartter syndrome is a rare inherited defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It is characterized by low potassium levels (hypokalemia),[1] increased blood pH (alkalosis), and normal to low blood pressure. There are two types of Bartter syndrome: neonatal and classic. A closely associated disorder, Gitelman syndrome, is milder than both subtypes of Bartter syndrome.

Batten disease is an extremely rare and fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins in childhood. It is the most common form of a group of disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs).
Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome (also known as "Bazex syndrome,"[1] and "Follicular atrophoderma and basal cell carcinomas"[1]) is a very rare condition inherited in an X-linked dominant fashion. Physical findings typically include follicular atrophoderma, multiple basal cell carcinomas, hypotrichosis, and hypohidrosis.[2]
Becker muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis. It is a type of dystrophinopathy.[1][2] This is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes the protein dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy is related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in that both result from a mutation in the dystrophin gene.[3]
Becker's nevus (also known as "Becker's melanosis," "Becker's pigmentary hamartoma," "Nevoid melanosis," and "Pigmented hairy epidermal nevus"[1]) is a skin disorder predominantly affecting males.[2]:687 The nevus generally first appears as an irregular pigmentation (melanosis or hyperpigmentation) on the torso or upper arm (though other areas of the body can be affected), and gradually enlarges irregularly, becoming thickened and often hairy (hypertrichosis). The nevus is due to an overgrowth of the epidermis, pigment cells (melanocytes), and hair follicles.[3] This form of nevus was first documented in 1948 by American dermatologist Samuel William Becker (1894–1964).[4]
Behr syndrome is characterized by the association of early-onset optic atrophy with spinocerebellar degeneration resulting in ataxia, pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy and developmental delay.[1][2]
Bell's palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in an inability to control the facial muscles on the affected side.[1] Symptoms can vary from mild to severe. They may include muscle twitching, weakness, or total loss of the ability to move one or rarely both sides of the face. Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, a change in taste, pain around the ear, and increased sensitivity to sound. Typically symptoms come on over 48 hours.[1]
Benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), also known as benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS) or benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) is an epilepsy syndrome. Affected children, who have no other health or developmental problems, develop seizures during infancy. These seizures have focal origin within the brain but may then spread to become generalised seizures. The seizures may occur several times a day, often grouped in clusters over one to three days followed by a gap of one to three months. Treatment with anticonvulsant drugs is not necessary but they are often prescribed and are effective at controlling the seizures. This form of epilepsy resolves after one or two years, and appears to be completely benign. The EEG of these children, between seizures, is normal. The brain appears normal on MRI scan.[2][3]
Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is a neurological disorder characterized by fasciculation (twitching) of various voluntary muscles in the body. The twitching can occur in any voluntary muscle group but is most common in the eyelids, arms, legs, and feet. Even the tongue may be affected. The twitching may be occasional or may go on nearly continuously. Usually intentional movement of the involved muscle causes the fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a disorder arising from a problem in the inner ear.[1] Symptoms are repeated brief periods of vertigo with movement, that is, of a spinning sensation caused by changes in the position of the head.[2] This can occur with turning in bed or changing position. Each episode of vertigo typically lasts less than one minute.[1] Nausea is commonly associated.[3] BPPV is one of the most common causes of vertigo.[2][4]
Benzodiazepine dependence or benzodiazepine addiction is when one has developed one or more of either tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, drug seeking behaviors, such as continued use despite harmful effects, and maladaptive pattern of substance use, according to the DSM-IV. In the case of benzodiazepine dependence, however, the continued use seems to be associated with the avoidance of unpleasant withdrawal reaction rather than from the pleasurable effects of the drug.[1] Benzodiazepine dependence develops with long-term use, even at low therapeutic doses,[2] without the described dependence behavior.[3][4]
Benzodiazepine overdose describes the ingestion of one of the drugs in the benzodiazepine class in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. Death as a result of taking an excessive dose of benzodiazepines alone is uncommon (versus combined drug intoxication) but does occasionally happen.[1] Deaths after hospital admission are considered to be low.[2] However, combinations of high doses of benzodiazepines with alcohol, barbiturates, opioids or tricyclic antidepressants are particularly dangerous, and may lead to severe complications such as coma or death. The most common symptoms of overdose include central nervous system (CNS) depression and intoxication with impaired balance, ataxia, and slurred speech. Severe symptoms include coma and respiratory depression. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. There is an antidote, flumazenil, but its use is controversial.[3]
Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome—often abbreviated to benzo withdrawal—is the cluster of symptoms that emerge when a person who has taken benzodiazepines, either medically or recreationally, and has developed a physical dependence undergoes dosage reduction or discontinuation. Development of physical dependence and/or addiction and the resulting withdrawal symptoms, some of which may last for years, may result from either drug-seeking behaviors or from taking the medication as prescribed. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty with concentration, confusion and cognitive difficulty, memory problems, dry retching and nausea, weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness, a host of perceptual changes, hallucinations, seizures, psychosis,[1] and suicide[2] (see "Signs and Symptoms" section below for full list). Further, these symptoms are notable for the manner in which they wax and wane and vary in severity from day to day or week by week instead of steadily decreasing in a straightforward monotonic manner.[3]
Berdon syndrome, also called Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIH syndrome),[1] is an autosomal recessive[2] fatal[3] genetic disorder affecting newborns. In a 2011 study of 227 children with the syndrome, "the oldest survivor [was] 24 years old."[3] The Ann Arbor News reported a five year old survivor at the end of 2015.[4] It is more prevalent in females, 7 females to 3 males,[3] and is characterized by constipation and urinary retention, microcolon, giant bladder (megacystis), intestinal hypoperistalis, hydronephrosis, and dilated small bowel. The pathological findings consist of an abundance of ganglion cells in both dilated and narrow areas of the intestine. It is a familial disturbance of unknown aetiology.
Beriberi refers to a cluster of symptoms caused primarily by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi has conventionally been divided into three separate entities, relating to the body system mainly involved (peripheral nervous system or cardiovascular) or age of person (like infantile). Beriberi is one of several thiamine-deficiency related conditions, which may occur concurrently, including Wernicke's encephalopathy (mainly affecting the central nervous system), Korsakoff's syndrome (amnesia with additional psychiatric manifestations), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with both neurologic and psychiatric symptoms).
Berylliosis, or chronic beryllium disease (CBD), is a chronic allergic-type lung response and chronic lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium and its compounds, a form of beryllium poisoning. It is distinct from acute beryllium poisoning, which became rare following occupational exposure limits established around 1950.[1] Berylliosis is an occupational lung disease.
Beta-mannosidosis, also called lysosomal beta-mannosidase deficiency,[1] is a disorder of oligosaccharide metabolism caused by decreased activity of the enzyme beta-mannosidase. This enzyme is coded for by the gene MANBA, located at 4q22-25. Beta-mannosidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[1] Affected individuals appear normal at birth, and can have a variable clinical presentation. Infantile onset forms show severe neurodegeneration, while some children have intellectual disability. Hearing loss and angiokeratomas are common features of the disease, however because it is so rare, the full phenotype associated with the disease is not fully understood.[2]
Bethlem myopathy is an autosomal dominant myopathy, classified as a congenital form of muscular dystrophy, that is caused by a mutation in one of the three genes coding for type VI collagen.[1] These include COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3.[2]
Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is an inherited form of heart disease in which two of the leaflets of the aortic valve fuse during development in the womb resulting in a two-leaflet valve (bicuspid valve) instead of the normal three-leaflet valve (tricuspid). BAV is the most common cause of heart disease present at birth and affects approximately 1.3% of adults.[1] Normally, the mitral valve is the only bicuspid valve and this is situated between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. Heart valves play a crucial role in ensuring the unidirectional flow of blood from the atrium to the ventricles, or from the ventricle to the aorta or pulmonary trunk.
This syndrome is similar to Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS). http://omim.org/entry/210350
Biliary atresia, also known as extrahepatic ductopenia and progressive obliterative cholangiopathy, is a childhood disease of the liver in which one or more bile ducts are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. It can be congenital or acquired. As a birth defect in newborn infants, it has an incidence of one in 10,000–15,000 live births in the United States,[2] and a prevalence of one in 16,700 in the British Isles.[3][4] Biliary atresia is most common in East Asia, with a frequency of one in 5,000.
Binswanger's disease, also known as subcortical leukoencephalopathy, is a form of small vessel vascular dementia caused by damage to the white brain matter.[1] White matter atrophy can be caused by many circumstances including chronic hypertension as well as old age.[2] This disease is characterized by loss of memory and intellectual function and by changes in mood. These changes encompass what are known as executive functions of the brain.[3] It usually presents between 54 and 66 years of age, and the first symptoms are usually mental deterioration or stroke.[4]
Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a mental disorder with periods of depression and periods of elevated mood.[2][3] The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable.[2] Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases.[3] During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others.[2] The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent.[2] Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated.[2]
Biotin deficiency is a rare nutritional disorder which can become serious, even fatal, if allowed to progress untreated. It can occur in people of any age, ancestry, or gender. Biotin is part of the B vitamin family. Biotin deficiency rarely occurs among healthy people because the daily requirement of biotin is low, many foods provide adequate amounts of it, intestinal bacteria synthesize small amounts of it, and the body effectively scavenges and recycles it from bodily waste. However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming raw egg whites over a period of months to years. Egg whites contain high levels of avidin, a protein that binds biotin strongly. When cooked, avidin is partially denatured and binding to biotin is reduced. However one study showed that 30-40% of the avidin activity was still present in the white after frying or boiling.[1] But cooked egg whites are safer to consume.[2] Genetic disorders such as Biotinidase deficiency, Multiple carboxylase deficiency, and Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency can also lead to inborn or late-onset forms of biotin deficiency.[citation needed] In all cases – dietary, genetic, or otherwise – supplementation with biotin is the primary method of treatment.[citation needed]
Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which biotin is not released from proteins in the diet during digestion or from normal protein turnover in the cell. This situation results in biotin deficiency.
Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a rare form of bilateral posterior uveitis affecting the eye. It causes severe, progressive inflammation of both the choroid and retina.
Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons[1] is a human autosomal dominant genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas are the most common manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.
Björnstad syndrome is an autosomal recessive congenital condition involving pili torti[1] and nerve deafness and hair abnormalities.
The BK virus is a member of the polyomavirus family. Past infection with the BK virus is widespread, but significant consequences of infection are uncommon, with the exception of the immunocompromised and the immunosuppressed.
Black piedra is a form of piedra caused by Piedraia hortae.[1]
A blastoma is a type of cancer, more common in children, that is caused by malignancies in precursor cells, often called blasts. Examples are nephroblastoma, medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma. The suffix -blastoma is used to imply a tumor of primitive, incompletely differentiated (or precursor) cells, e.g., chondroblastoma is composed of cells resembling the precursor of chondrocytes.
Blastomycosis (also known as "North American blastomycosis", "Blastomycetic dermatitis", and "Gilchrist's disease"[2]) is a fungal infection of humans and other animals, notably dogs and occasionally cats, caused by the organism Blastomyces dermatitidis. Endemic to portions of North America, blastomycosis causes clinical symptoms similar to histoplasmosis.[3] The disease occurs in several endemic areas the most important of which is in eastern North America, particularly in the western and northern periphery of the Great Lakes Basin, extending eastward along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River Valley and southward in the territory spanned by the central Appalachian Mountains in the east, to the Mississippi River Valley in the west. Sporadic cases have been reported in continental Africa,[4] the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.
Blepharitis (/blɛfəˈraɪtᵻs/ BLEF-ər-EYE-tis) is a common eye condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the eyelid, usually where eyelashes grow, resulting in inflamed, irritated, itchy, and reddened eyelids. A number of diseases and conditions can lead to blepharitis. It can be caused by the oil glands at the base of the eyelashes becoming clogged, a bacterial infection, allergies, or other conditions. The severity and course can vary. Onset can be acute, resolving without treatment within 2–4 weeks (this can be greatly reduced with lid hygiene), but more generally is a long-standing chronic inflammation of varying severity.
Blepharophimosis is a congenital condition characterized by a horizontally narrow palpebral fissure. It is also part of a syndrome Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome, also called Blepharophimosis syndrome, which is a condition where the patient has bilateral ptosis with reduced lid size, vertically and horizontally. The nasal bridge is flat and there is hypoplastic orbital rim.[1] Both the vertical and horizontal palpebral fissures (eyelid opening) are shortened; the eyes are also spaced more widely apart than usual, also known as telecanthus. Vignes (1889) probably first described this entity, a dysplasia of the eyelids.
Blepharospasm is any abnormal contraction or twitch of the eyelid. In most cases, symptoms last for a few days then disappear without treatment, but sometimes the twitching is chronic and persistent, causing lifelong challenges. In those rare cases, the symptoms are often severe enough to result in functional blindness. The person's eyelids feel like they are clamping shut and will not open without great effort. People have normal eyes, but for periods of time are effectively blind due to their inability to open their eyelids. In contrast, the reflex blepharospasm is due to any pain in and around the eye.
Bloom syndrome (often abbreviated as BS in literature),[1] also known as Bloom-Torre-Machacek syndrome,[2] is a rare autosomal recessive[3][4] disorder characterized by short stature, predisposition to the development of cancer and genomic instability.[5] BS is caused by mutations in the BLM gene leading to mutated DNA helicase protein formation. Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). The condition was discovered and first described by New York dermatologist Dr. David Bloom in 1954.[6]
Blount's disease is a growth disorder of the tibia (shin bone) that causes the lower leg to angle inward, resembling a bowleg.
Blue diaper syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized in infants by bluish urine-stained diapers. It is also known as Drummond's syndrome, and hypercalcemia.[1]
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation that some aspect of one's own appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix it.[1] In BDD's delusional variant, the flaw is imagined.[2] If the flaw is actual, its importance is severely exaggerated.[2] Either way, one's thoughts about it are pervasive and intrusive, occupying up to several hours a day. The DSM-5 categorizes BDD in the obsessive–compulsive spectrum, and distinguishes it from anorexia nervosa.
A boil, also called a furuncle, is a deep folliculitis, infection of the hair follicle. It is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue.[1] Boils which are expanded are basically pus-filled nodules.[2][verification needed] Individual boils clustered together are called carbuncles.[3] Most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive S. aureus strains, notable for the bacteria's ability to produce coagulase, an enzyme that can clot blood. Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus.
Machupo virus
Bone marrow failure occurs in individuals who produce an insufficient amount of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. Red blood cells transport oxygen to be distributed throughout the body’s tissue. White blood cells fight off infections that enter the body. Bone marrow also contains platelets, which trigger clotting, and thus help stop the blood flow when a wound occurs. [1]
Boomerang dysplasia is a lethal form of osteochondrodysplasia[1] known for a characteristic congenital feature in which bones of the arms and legs are malformed into the shape of a boomerang.[2] Death usually occurs in early infancy due to complications arising from overwhelming systemic bone malformations.[1]
Borderline personality disorder (BPD), also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder, is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions.[3][4] There is often an extreme fear of abandonment, frequent dangerous behavior, a feeling of emptiness, and self-harm. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events.[3] The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.[4] Substance abuse, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD.[3] BPD increases the risk of self-harm and 10% of people affected die by suicide.[3][4]
Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.[1]
Bowen–Conradi syndrome (BCS[1] or BWCNS[2]) is a disease in humans that can affect children.[2] The disease is due to an autosomal recessive abnormality of the EMG1 gene, which plays a role in small ribosomal subunit (SSU) assembly.[1][3] The preponderance of diagnoses has been in North American Hutterite children, but BWCNS can affect other population groups.[2][4]
Bowenoid papulosis is a cutaneous condition characterized by the presence of pigmented verrucous papules on the body of the penis.[1]:730[2]:408 They are associated with human papillomavirus, the causative agent of genital warts.[3] The lesions have a typical dysplastic histology and are generally considered benign, although a small percentage will develop malignant characteristics.
Bowen's disease (BD), also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ[1] is a neoplastic skin disease. It can be considered as an early stage or intraepidermal form of squamous cell carcinoma. It was named after John T. Bowen. Erythroplasia of Queyrat is a particular type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ which can arise on the glans or prepuce in males and vulva in females, and may be induced by human papilloma virus.[2] It is reported to occur in the corneoscleral limbus.[3]
Brachydactyly (Greek βραχύς = "short" plus δάκτυλος = "finger"), is a medical term which literally means "shortness of the fingers and toes" (digits). The shortness is relative to the length of other long bones and other parts of the body. Brachydactyly is an inherited, usually dominant trait. It most often occurs as an isolated dysmelia, but can also occur with other anomalies as part of many congenital syndromes.
Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS)[1] is a disease that arises from a mutation in the TFAP2A gene. It is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that starts to affect a child's development before birth.[1] Symptoms of this condition include skin abnormalities on the neck, deformities of the ears and eyes, and other distinctive facial features such a cleft lip along with slow growth, mental retardation and premature graying of hair.[2]
Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR), also known as branchiootorenal syndrome or BOR syndrome, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder involving the kidneys, ears, and neck. It often has also been described as Melnick-Fraser syndrome.[1][2]
Sabiá virus
Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue.[1] Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin.[2] In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.[3]
Brief psychotic disorder is a period of psychosis whose duration is generally shorter, not always non-recurring, but can be and not caused by another condition.
Bright's disease is a historical classification of kidney diseases that would be described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis.[1] It was characterized by edema, the presence of albumin in the urine and was frequently accompanied by high blood pressure (hypertension).
Bronchiectasis is a disease in which there is permanent enlargement of parts of the airways of the lung.[1] Symptoms typically include a chronic cough productive of mucus.[2] Other symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and chest pain.[3] Wheezing and nail clubbing may also occur.[3] Those with the disease often get frequent lung infections.[4]
Bronchogenic cysts are small, solitary cysts or sinuses, most typically located in the region of the suprasternal notch or over the manubrium.[1]:682
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; formerly chronic lung disease of infancy) is a chronic lung disorder of infants and children first described in 1967. It is more common in infants with low birth weight and those who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It results in significant morbidity and mortality. The definition of BPD has continued to evolve since then primarily due to changes in the population, such as more survivors at earlier gestational ages, and improved neonatal management including surfactant, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, and less aggressive mechanical ventilation.[1]
Brown-Séquard syndrome (also known as Brown-Séquard's hemiplegia, Brown-Séquard's paralysis, hemiparaplegic syndrome, hemiplegia et hemiparaplegia spinalis, or spinal hemiparaplegia) is caused by damage to one half of the spinal cord, resulting in paralysis and loss of proprioception on the same (or ipsilateral) side as the injury or lesion, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (or contralateral) side as the lesion. It is named after physiologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who first described the condition in 1850.[1]
Brucellosis[2][3] is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from infected animals, or close contact with their secretions.[4]
Bruck syndrome is characterized as the combination of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and osteogenesis imperfecta. Both diseases are uncommon, but concurrence is extremely rare which makes Bruck syndrome very difficult to research.[1] Bruck syndrome is thought to be an atypical variant of osteogenesis imperfecta most resembling type III, if not its own disease.[2][3] Multiple gene mutations associated with osteogenesis imperfecta are not seen in Bruck syndrome. Many affected individuals are within the same family, and pedigree data supports that the disease is acquired through autosomal recessive inheritance.[4] Bruck syndrome has features of congenital contractures, bone fragility, recurring bone fractures, flexion joint and limb deformities, pterygia, short body height, and progressive kyphoscoliosis. Individuals encounter restricted mobility and pulmonary function. A reduction in bone mineral content and larger hydroxyapatite crystals are also detectable[5] Joint contractures are primarily bilateral and symmetrical, and most prone to ankles.[3] Bruck syndrome has no effect on intelligence, vision, or hearing.[4]
Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic disease that is characterised by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is named for the Spanish cardiologists Pedro Brugada (nl), Josep Brugada and Ramon Brugada. It is the major[1][2] cause of sudden unexplained death syndrome (SUDS), also known as sudden adult death syndrome (SADS), and is the most common cause of sudden death in young men without known underlying cardiac disease in Thailand and Laos.[3]
Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.[1] Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop. This includes fever, headaches, and vomiting.[1] Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.[2] Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.[1]
Budd–Chiari syndrome is a very rare condition, affecting 1 in a million adults.[1] The condition is caused by occlusion of the hepatic veins that drain the liver. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and liver enlargement. The formation of a blood clot within the hepatic veins can lead to Budd–Chiari syndrome. The syndrome can be fulminant, acute, chronic, or asymptomatic.
Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives.[1] Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise.[1][2] Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight.[3] The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol.[1] There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.[4]
Bullous pemphigoid is an acute or chronic autoimmune skin disease, involving the formation of blisters, more appropriately known as bullae, at the space between the epidermis and dermis skin layers. It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction, with the formation of anti-hemidesmosome antibodies.
Burkitt lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, particularly B lymphocytes found in the germinal center. It is named after Denis Parsons Burkitt, a surgeon who first described the disease in 1958 while working in equatorial Africa.[1][2]
Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a burning sensation in the mouth with no underlying dental or medical cause. No signs of disease are found in the mouth.[3] People with burning mouth syndrome may also have a dry mouth sensation where no cause can be found such as reduced salivary flow, tingling in the mouth, or an altered taste or smell.[3]
Buruli ulcer (also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer, Searls ulcer, or Daintree ulcer[1][2][3]) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans.[4] The early stage of the infection is characterised by a painless nodule or area of swelling.[4] This nodule can turn into an ulcer.[4] The ulcer may be larger inside than at the surface of the skin,[5] and can be surrounded by swelling.[5] As the disease worsens, bone can be infected.[4] Buruli ulcers most commonly affect the arms or legs;[4] fever is uncommon.[4]
Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome, also known as Dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata,[1] is a rare genetic disorder associated with LEMD3. It is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[2]
Byssinosis, also called "brown lung disease" or "Monday fever", is an occupational lung disease caused by exposure to cotton dust in inadequately ventilated working environments.[1] Byssinosis commonly occurs in workers who are employed in yarn and fabric manufacture industries. It is now thought that the cotton dust directly causes the disease and some believe that the causative agents are endotoxins that come from the cell walls of gram negative bacteria that grow on the cotton. Although bacterial endotoxin is a likely cause, the absence of similar symptoms in workers in other industries exposed to endotoxins makes this uncertain.[2]
Angioedema, also known as angiooedema, Quincke's edema, and angioneurotic edema, is the rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue,[1] mucosa and submucosal tissues. It is very similar to urticaria, but urticaria, commonly known as hives, occurs in the upper dermis.[1]
Café au lait spots or café au lait macules are flat, pigmented birthmarks.[1] The name café au lait is French for "coffee with milk" and refers to their light-brown color. They are also called "giraffe spots" or "coast of Maine spots".[2]
Caffeine-induced sleep disorder is a psychiatric disorder that results from overconsumption of the stimulant caffeine. "When caffeine is consumed immediately before bedtime or continuously throughout the day, sleep onset may be delayed, total sleep time reduced, normal stages of sleep altered, and the quality of sleep decreased."[1] Caffeine reduces slow-wave sleep in the early part of the sleep cycle and can reduce rapid eye movement sleep later in the cycle. Caffeine increases episodes of wakefulness, and high doses in the late evening can increase sleep onset latency. In elderly people, there is an association between use of medication containing caffeine and difficulty in falling asleep.[2]
Calcinosis cutis (or cutaneous calcification) is a type of calcinosis wherein calcium deposits form in the skin. A variety of factors can result in this condition. The most common source is dystrophic calcification, which occurs in soft tissue as a response to injury. In addition, calcinosis is seen in Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome (the "C" in CREST). In dogs, calcinosis cutis is found in young, large breed dogs and is thought to occur after a traumatic injury.
CREST syndrome, also known as the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder. The acronym "CREST" refers to the five main features: calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.[1] It is associated with detectable antibodies against centromeres (a component of the cell nucleus), and usually spares the kidneys (a feature more common in the related condition systemic scleroderma). If the lungs are involved, it is usually in the form of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), is a syndrome of calcification of the blood vessels, blood clots, and skin necrosis. It is seen mostly in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, but can occur in the absence of kidney failure.[1] It results in chronic non-healing wounds and is usually fatal. Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious disease, believed to affect 1-4% of all dialysis patients.[2]
A calculus (plural calculi), often called a stone, is a concretion of material, usually mineral salts, that forms in an organ or duct of the body. Formation of calculi is known as lithiasis (/ˌlɪˈθaɪəsᵻs/). Stones can cause a number of medical conditions.
Campylobacteriosis is an infection by the Campylobacter bacterium,[1] most commonly C. jejuni. It is among the most common bacterial infections of humans, often a foodborne illness. It produces an inflammatory, sometimes bloody, diarrhea or dysentery syndrome, mostly including cramps, fever and pain.
Camurati–Engelmann disease (CED) is a very rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that causes characteristic anomalies in the skeleton. It is a form of dysplasia.[1] Patients typically have heavily thickened bones, especially along the shafts of the long bones (called diaphyseal dysplasia). The skull bones may be thickened so that the passages through the skull that carry nerves and blood vessels become narrowed, possibly leading to sensory deficits, blindness, or deafness.
Candidiasis is a fungal infection due to any type of Candida (a type of yeast).[2] When it affects the mouth, it is commonly called thrush.[2] Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat.[3] Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing.[3] When it affects the vagina, it is commonly called a yeast infection.[2] Signs and symptoms include genital itching, burning, and sometimes a white "cottage cheese-like" discharge from the vagina.[4] Less commonly the penis may be affected, resulting in itchiness.[3] Very rarely, the infection may become invasive spreading throughout the body, resulting in fevers along with other symptoms depending on the parts of the body affected.[5]
In radiology, Canga's bead symptom is the irregular appearance of uterus and nodular structures in tuba uterina observed in patients with genital tuberculosis.[1]
Canine distemper (sometimes termed hardpad disease in canine) is a viral disease that affects a wide variety of animal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, and a variety of other species. It was long believed that animals in the family Felidae, including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to canine distemper, until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids.[1] It is now known that both large Felidae and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogs[1][2] or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats,[1] but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.[2]
Caplan's syndrome (or Caplan disease or Rheumatoid pneumoconiosis[1]) is a combination of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pneumoconiosis that manifests as intrapulmonary nodules, which appear homogenous and well-defined on chest X-ray.[2]
Carcinoid syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome comprising the signs and symptoms that occur secondary to carcinoid tumors. The syndrome includes flushing and diarrhea, and, less frequently, heart failure and bronchoconstriction.[1] It is caused by endogenous secretion of mainly serotonin and kallikrein.
Cardiac amyloidosis is any of several forms of amyloidosis (the accumulation of inappropriately folded proteins) in or affecting the heart.
Cardiac arrest is a sudden stop in effective blood flow due to the failure of the heart to contract effectively.[2] Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing.[1][3] Some people may have chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before this occurs.[3] If not treated within minutes, death usually occurs.[2]
Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade, is when fluid in the pericardium (the sac around the heart) builds up and results in compression of the heart.[1] Onset may be rapid or more gradual.[1] Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause.[2]
Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome (CFC syndrome) is an extremely rare and serious genetic disorder.[1][2]
Cardiomyopathy is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle.[1] Early on there may be few or no symptoms. Some people may have shortness of breath, feel tired, or have swelling of the legs due to heart failure. An irregular heart beat may occur as well as fainting.[2] Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.[3]
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which a portion of the myocardium (heart muscle) is hypertrophic (enlarged) without any obvious cause, creating functional impairment of the heart.[2][3][4] It is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.[5] The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in any age group and a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.[6] In most patients, HCM is associated with little or no disability and normal life expectancy.[2]
Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a form of cardiomyopathy in which the walls are rigid,[2] and the heart is restricted from stretching and filling with blood properly. It is the least common of John Forrest Goodwin's three original subtypes of cardiomyopathy, which includes hypertrophic and dilated as well as restrictive.[1]
Systemic primary carnitine deficiency, (SPCD) also known as carnitine uptake defect, carnitine transporter deficiency (CTD) or systemic carnitine deficiency is an inborn error of fatty acid transport caused by a defect in the transporter responsible for moving carnitine across the plasma membrane. Carnitine is an important amino acid for fatty acid metabolism.[1] When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, fatty acid oxidation is impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction. The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the SLC22A5 gene located on chromosome 5. SPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutated alleles coming from both parents.
Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that prevents the body from converting long-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during periods without food. Carnitine, a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy. People with this disorder have a faulty enzyme that prevents long-chain fatty acids from being transported into the innermost part of the mitochondria for processing.
Carnosinemia, also called carnosinase deficiency[1] or aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase deficiency,[2] is a rare autosomal recessive[3] metabolic disorder[4] caused by a deficiency of carnosinase, a dipeptidase (a type of enzyme that splits dipeptides into their two amino acid constituents).[5]
Caroli disease is a rare inherited disorder characterized by dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. There are two types of Caroli disease, the most common being the simple, or isolated case where the bile ducts are widened by ectasia. The second, more complex, cause is commonly known as Caroli Syndrome. This complex form is also linked with portal hypertension and congenital hepatic fibrosis.[1] The differences between the causes of the two cases have not yet been discovered. Caroli disease is also associated with liver failure and polycystic kidney disease. The disease affects about 1 in 1,000,000 people, with more reported cases of Caroli syndrome than of Caroli disease. [2]
Carotid artery dissection is a separation of the layers of the artery wall supplying oxygen-bearing blood to the head and brain and is the most common cause of stroke in young adults.[1] (In vascular medicine, dissection is a blister-like de-lamination between the outer and inner walls of a blood vessel, generally originating with a partial leak in the inner lining.)[2]
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel.[1] The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers.[1] Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night.[2] Pain may extend up the arm.[2] Weak grip strength may occur and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away.[2] In more than half of cases both sides are affected.[1]
Carpenter syndrome, also called acrocephalopolysyndactyly type II,[1] is an extremely rare autosomal recessive[2] congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial malformations, obesity, and syndactyly.[2]
Cartilage–hair hypoplasia (CHH), also known as McKusick type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia,[1]:578 is a rare genetic disorder. It is a highly pleiotropic disorder that clinically manifests by form of short-limbed dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia, variable level of immunodeficiency and predisposition to malignancies in some cases. It was first reported in 1965 by McKusick et al. Actor Verne Troyer is affected with this form of dwarfism,[2] as was actor Billy Barty, who was renowned for saying "The name of my condition is Cartilage Hair Syndrome Hypoplasia, but you can just call me Billy."[3]
Castleman disease, also known as giant lymph node hyperplasia, lymphoid hamartoma, or angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, is a group of uncommon lymphoproliferative disorders that share common lymph node histological features that may be localized to a single lymph node (unicentric) or occur systemically (multicentric). It is named after Benjamin Castleman.[1][2]
Cri du chat syndrome, also known as chromosome 5p deletion syndrome, 5p− (said minus) syndrome or Lejeune’s syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder due to chromosome deletion on chromosome 5.[1] Its name is a French term (cat-cry or call of the cat) referring to the characteristic cat-like cry of affected children.[2] It was first described by Jérôme Lejeune in 1963.[3] The condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 live births across all ethnicities and is more common in females by a 4:3 ratio.[4]
Cat eye syndrome (CES), or Schmid–Fraccaro syndrome, is a rare condition caused by the short arm (p) and a small section of the long arm (q) of human chromosome 22 being present three (trisomic) or four times (tetrasomic) (usually 3 times) instead of the usual two times.[1] The term "cat eye" syndrome was coined because of the particular appearance of the vertical colobomas in the eyes of some patients. However, over half of the CES patients in the literature do not present with this trait.[citation needed] There is no significant reduction in life expectancy in patients who are not afflicted with one of CES' life-threatening abnormalities.
A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night.[1] This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces.[2] Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression.[3] Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.[4][5]
The term congenital cataract refers to a lens opacity present at birth. Congenital cataracts cover a broad spectrum of severity: whereas some lens opacities do not progress and are visually insignificant, others can produce profound visual impairment.

Catel–Manzke syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive abnormalities of the index fingers; the classic features of Pierre Robin syndrome; occasionally with additional physical findings. Pierre Robin syndrome refers to a sequence of abnormalities that may occur as a distinct syndrome or as part of another underlying disorder. Pierre Robin syndrome is characterized by an unusually small jaw (Micrognathia), downward displacement or retraction of the tongue (Glossoptosis), and incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (Cleft palate). It is also linked to Hyper Mobility Syndrome.
Caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis (or hypoplasia of the sacrum) is a congenital disorder in which there is abnormal fetal development of the lower spine—the caudal partition of the spine.[1]
Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, cavernoma, or cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) (when referring to presence in the brain)[1] is a type of blood vessel malformation or hemangioma, where a collection of dilated blood vessels form a benign tumor. Because of this malformation, blood flow through the cavities, or caverns, is slow. Additionally, the cells that form the vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells. Also, the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood, known as a hemorrhage from these vessels that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with this disease.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is the formation of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity at the base of the brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria. Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision, chemosis, exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.[1]
Cenani–Lenz syndactylism, also known as Cenani–Lenz syndrome or Cenani–syndactylism,[1][2] is an autosomal recessive congenital malformation syndrome[3][4] involving both upper and lower extremities.
Central core disease (CCD), also known as central core myopathy, is an autosomal dominant[1] congenital myopathy (inborn muscle disorder). It was first described by Shy and Magee in 1956.[2][3] It is characterized by the appearance of the myofibril under the microscope.[4]
Cerebellar agenesis is a rare condition in which a brain develops without the cerebellum. The cerebellum controls smooth movement, and when it does not develop, the rest of the brain must compensate, which it cannot do completely.[1] The condition is not fatal on its own, but people born without a cerebellum experience severe developmental delays, language deficits, and neurological abnormalities.[2] As children with cerebellar agenesis get older, their movements usually improve.[3] It can co-exist with other severe malformations of the central nervous system, like anencephaly, holoprosencephaly, and microencephaly.[1]
Cerebellar hypoplasia is a heterogeneous group of disorder of cerebellar maldevelopment presenting as early onset non progressive ataxia, hypotonia, and motor learning disability. Various causes has been incriminated like hereditary, metabolic, toxic and viral agents. First reported by Crouzon in 1929.[1] In 1940 an unclaimed body came for dissection in London Hospital and was discovered to have no cerebellum. This unique case was appropriately named "human brain without a cerebellum" and was used every year in the Department of Anatomy at Cambridge University in a neuroscience course for medical students.[2]
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), also known as congophilic angiopathy,[1] is a form of angiopathy in which amyloid deposits form in the walls of the blood vessels of the central nervous system.[2] The term congophilic is used because the presence of the abnormal aggregations of amyloid can be demonstrated by microscopic examination of brain tissue after application of a special stain called Congo red. The amyloid material is only found in the brain and as such the disease is not related to other forms of amyloidosis.[3]
Cerebral hypoxia is a form of hypoxia (reduced supply of oxygen), specifically involving the brain; when the brain is completely deprived of oxygen, it is called cerebral anoxia. There are four categories of cerebral hypoxia; they are, in order of severity: diffuse cerebral hypoxia (DCH), focal cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, and global cerebral ischemia. Prolonged hypoxia induces neuronal cell death via apoptosis, resulting in a hypoxic brain injury.[1][2]
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, swallowing, and speaking. Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl, or walk as early as other children of their age. Difficulty with the ability to think or reason and seizures each occurs in about one third of people with CP. While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life, the underlying problems do not worsen over time.[1]
Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix.[1] It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2] Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse.[1] While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer.[3]
Cervical spinal stenosis is a bone disease involving the narrowing of the spinal canal at the level of the neck. It is frequently due to chronic degeneration,[1] but may also be congenital. Treatment is frequently surgical.[1]
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi.[1] It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs.[1] The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.[1] After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms.[2][3] The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection,[3] including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure.[1] An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.[1]
Chalazion is a cyst in the eyelid due to a blocked oil gland.[2] They are typically in the middle of the eyelid, red, and non painful. They tend to come on gradually over a few weeks.[3]
Chancroid (also known as soft chancre[1] and ulcus molle[2]) is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful sores on the genitalia. Chancroid is known to spread from one individual to another solely through sexual contact.
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies, a group of varied inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system characterised by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body. Currently incurable, this disease is the most commonly inherited neurological disorder, and affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people.[1][2] CMT was previously classified as a subtype of muscular dystrophy.[1]

CHARGE syndrome (formerly known as CHARGE association), is a rare syndrome caused by a genetic disorder. First described in 1979, the acronym "CHARGE" came into use for newborn children with the congenital features of coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the nasal choanae, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and ear abnormalities and deafness.[1] These features are no longer used in making a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, but the name remains. About two third of cases are due to a CHD7 mutation. CHARGE syndrome occurs only in 0.1–1.2 per 10,000 live births; as of 2009 it was the leading cause of congenital deafblindness in the US.[2]
Chemophobia (or chemphobia or chemonoia[1][2]) is an aversion to or prejudice against chemicals or chemistry. The phenomenon has been ascribed both to a reasonable concern over the potential adverse effects of synthetic chemicals, and to an irrational fear of these substances because of misconceptions about their potential for harm.[3][4] People marketing products react to widespread chemophobia with products marketed with an appeal to nature.
Cherubism is a rare genetic disorder that causes prominence in the lower portion in the face. The name is derived from the temporary chubby-cheeked resemblance to putti, often confused with cherubs, in Renaissance paintings.
Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV).[1] The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over.[2] It usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads to the rest of the body.[2] Other symptoms may include fever, feeling tired, and headaches.[2] Symptoms usually last five to ten days.[2] Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, or bacterial infections of the skin among others.[3] The disease is often more severe in adults than children.[4] Symptoms begin ten to twenty-one days after exposure to the virus.[5]
Chikungunya is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV).[2] Symptoms include the fever and joint pain.[3] These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure.[2] Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Most people are better within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months.[3] The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000.[4] The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease.[3]
The childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), also known as Heller's syndrome and disintegrative psychosis, is a rare condition characterized by late onset of developmental delays—or stunning reversals—in language, social function, and motor skills. Researchers have not been successful in finding a cause for the disorder. CDD has some similarity to autism, and is sometimes considered a low-functioning form of it.[1][2] In May 2013, the term CDD, along with other types of autism, was fused into a single diagnostic term called "autism spectrum disorder" under the new DSM-5 manual.[3] Therefore, CDD is now also called "regressive autism", being that this term can now refer to any type of autism spectrum disorder that involves regression, including CDD.[4]
Chlamydia trachomatis (/kləˌmɪdiə/ /trəˈkoʊmətᵻs/), commonly known as chlamydia,[2] is one of four bacterial species in the genus Chlamydia.[3] Chlamydia is a genus of pathogenic bacteria that are obligate intracellular parasites. C. trachomatis is a Gram-negative bacterium. It is ovoid in shape and nonmotile. The bacteria are nonspore-forming, but the elementary bodies act like spores when released into the host.[4] The inclusion bodies of C. trachomatis were first described in 1942. C. trachomatis agent was first cultured in the yolk sacs of eggs by Professor Tang Fei-fan, et al. in 1957.[5][6]
Chlamydia infection, often simply known as Chlamydia, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.[1] Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.[2] The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.[3] Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in trachoma, a common cause of blindness in the developing world.[4]
Cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer is a form of cancer that is composed of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder.[5] Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are common.[1] Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or inflammation of the common bile duct.[1][5]
Cholemia is a condition caused by the presence of excess bile in the blood. Its symptoms can include somnolence (drowsiness) and, in extreme cases, coma. It is often a sign of liver disease.[1]
Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.[1] Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe.[2] The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days.[3] Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur.[2] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.[3] This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet.[4] The dehydration may result in the skin turning bluish.[5] Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[2]
Cholestasis is a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum. The two basic distinctions are an obstructive type of cholestasis where there is a mechanical blockage in the duct system that can occur from a gallstone or malignancy, and metabolic types of cholestasis which are disturbances in bile formation that can occur because of genetic defects or acquired as a side effect of many medications.
Chondroblastoma is a rare, benign, locally aggressive bone tumor that typically affects the epiphyses or apophyses of long bones.[1][2] It is thought to arise from an outgrowth of immature cartilage cells (chondroblasts) from secondary ossification centers, originating from the epiphyseal plate or some remnant of it.[2][3]
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, also known as pseudogout and pyrophosphate arthropathy is a rheumatologic disorder with varied symptoms and signs arising from the accumulation of crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate in the connective tissues. The alternative names emphasize particular aspects of the clinical or radiographic findings. The knee joint is the most commonly affected.[1]

Chondrodystrophy (literally, "cartilage maldevelopment") refers to a skeletal disorder caused by one of myriad genetic mutations that can affect the development of cartilage.[1] As a very general term it is only used in the medical literature when a more precise description of the condition is unavailable.
Chondrosarcoma is a cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage.[1] Chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas. About 30% of skeletal system cancers are chondrosarcomas.[2] It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone cancers that mainly affect children and adolescents, chondrosarcoma can present at any age. It more often affects the axial skeleton than the appendicular skeleton.[3]
Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm thought to arise from cellular remnants of the notochord. The evidence for this is the location of the tumors (along the neuraxis), the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions when the remainder of the notochord regresses during fetal life.
Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc, also called Choreoacanthocytosis),[1] is a rare hereditary disease caused by a mutation of the gene that directs structural proteins in red blood cells. It belongs to a group of four diseases characterized under the name Neuroacanthocytosis.[2] When a patient's blood is viewed under a microscope, some of the red blood cells appear thorny. These thorny cells are called acanthocytes.
Choriocarcinoma is a malignant, trophoblastic[1] cancer, usually of the placenta. It is characterized by "early hematogenous spread"[this quote needs a citation] to the lungs. It belongs to the malignant end of the spectrum in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It is also classified as a germ cell tumor and may arise in the testis or ovary.
Chorioretinitis is an inflammation of the choroid (thin pigmented vascular coat of the eye) and retina of the eye. It is a form of posterior uveitis. If only the choroid is inflamed, not the retina, the condition is termed choroiditis.[1] The ophthalmologist's goal in treating these potentially blinding conditions is to eliminate the inflammation and minimize the potential risk of therapy to the patient.
Choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) are cysts that occur within choroid plexus of the brain. The brain contains pockets or spaces called ventricles with a spongy layer of cells and blood vessels called the choroid plexus. This is in the middle of the fetal brain. The choroid plexus has the important function of producing cerebrospinal fluid. The fluid produced by the cells of the choroid plexus fills the ventricles and then flows around the brain and the spinal cord to provide a cushion of fluid around these structures.
Choroideremia /kɒˌrɔɪdᵻˈriːmi.ə/ (CHM) is a rare, X-linked recessive form of hereditary retinal degeneration that affects roughly 1 in 50,000 males. The disease causes a gradual loss of vision, starting with childhood night blindness, followed by peripheral vision loss, and progressing to loss of central vision later in life. Progression continues throughout the individual's life, but both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family.[1]
Chromhidrosis (also referred to as "colored sweat"[1]) is a rare condition characterized by the secretion of colored sweat.[2] It is caused by the deposition of lipofuscin in the sweat glands. Cases of red, blue, green, yellow, pink, and black sweat have been reported.[by whom?] Usually chromhidrosis affects the apocrine glands, mainly on the face and underarms. A limited number of treatment options exist, including regular application of Capsaicin cream and prolonged relief may be provided by botulinum toxin treatment. Chromogenic pigments produced by bacteria (Corynebacterium in particular) are implicated in this condition but their exact role still requires careful microbiological elucidation. Chromhidrosis of the eccrine glands is rare, it occurs mainly after the ingestion of certain dyes or drugs.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other symptoms that limit a person's ability to carry out ordinary daily activities.[2][3] Quality of life of persons with CFS can be compromised.[4]
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (also known as Bridges–Good syndrome, chronic granulomatous disorder, and Quie syndrome[1]) is a diverse group of hereditary diseases in which certain cells of the immune system have difficulty forming the reactive oxygen compounds (most importantly the superoxide radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase) used to kill certain ingested pathogens.[2] This leads to the formation of granulomata in many organs.[3] CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States, with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.[4][5]
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The disorder is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (CRP) or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (because it involves the nerve roots).[1] CIDP is closely related to Guillain–Barré syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease. Its symptoms are also similar to progressive inflammatory neuropathy. An asymmetrical variant of CIDP is known as Lewis-Sumner Syndrome.[2]
Chronic mountain sickness (CMS or Monge's disease) is a disease in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases (polycythaemia) and there is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxaemia). CMS typically develops after extended time living at high altitude (over 2,500 metres (8,200 ft)) so is most common amongst native populations of high altitude nations.[1] The most frequent symptoms of CMS are headache, dizziness, tinnitus, breathlessness, palpitations, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion, cyanosis, and dilation of veins.[2]

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a type of leukaemia, which are cancers of the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. In adults, blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, by a process that is known as haematopoiesis. In CMML, there are increased numbers of monocytes and immature blood cells (blasts) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, as well as abnormal looking cells (dysplasia) in at least one type of blood cell.[1]
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term poor airflow. The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD typically worsens over time.[1] Eventually walking up stairs or carrying things becomes difficult.[2] Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD.[2][3] The term "chronic bronchitis" is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.[4]
Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) ("multifocal" because it can erupt in different sites, primarily bones; "osteomyelitis" because it is very similar to that disease but appears to be without any infection), also known as chronic recurring multifocal osteomyelitis, is a rare condition (1:1,000,000), in which the bones have lesions, inflammation, and pain. Its definition is evolving. Many doctors and articles described CRMO as an autoimmune disease that has symptoms similar to osteomyelitis, but without the infection. Some doctors thought CRMO was related to SAPHO syndrome. Cutting edge research now classifies CRMO as an inherited autoinflammatory disease but have yet to isolate the exact gene responsible for it. Some specialists believe they have discovered a link between CRMO with a rare allele of marker D18S60, resulting in a haplotype relative risk (HRR) of 18. Other experts found that "mutations in LPIN2 cause a syndromic form of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis known as Majeed syndrome, while mutations in pstpip2 cause a murine form of the disorder. The roles played by LPIN2 and the human homolog of pstpip2, PSTPIP2, in the etiology of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis are uncertain but are currently being investigated."[1] The professional theories seem to be moving in the direction of an inherited gene.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (also known as "Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid", "MMP", "Benign mucosal pemphigoid," "Benign mucous membrane pemphigoid,"[1] "Ocular pemphigus,"[1] and "Scarring pemphigoid"[1]) is a rare chronic autoimmune subepithelial blistering disease characterized by erosive skin lesions of the mucous membranes and skin that results in scarring of at least some sites of involvement.[2]:581
Cinchonism or quinism is a pathological condition caused by an overdose of quinine or quinidine, or their natural source, cinchona bark. Quinine is medically used to treat malaria. In much smaller amounts, quinine is an ingredient of tonic drinks, acting as a bittering agent. Cinchonism can occur from therapeutic doses of quinine, either from one or several large doses. Quinidine (Class 1A anti-arrhythmic) can also cause cinchonism symptoms to develop with as little as a single dose.
Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood.[1] Since the substances also accumulate in the urine, the disorder can also be called citrullinuria.
Capillary leak syndrome (also known as systemic capillary leak syndrome, SCLS, or Clarkson’s disease) is an extremely rare medical condition characterized by self-reversing episodes during which the endothelial cells which line the capillaries are thought to separate for a few days, allowing for a leakage of fluid from the circulatory system to the interstitial space, resulting in a dangerous hypotension (low blood pressure), hemoconcentration, and hypoalbuminemia. It is a life-threatening illness because each episode has the potential to cause damage to, or the failure of, vital organs due to limited perfusion. It is often misdiagnosed as polycythemia, polycythemia vera, or sepsis.
Cloacal exstrophy (EC) is a severe birth defect wherein much of the abdominal organs (the bladder and intestines) are exposed. It often causes the splitting of both male and female genitalia (specifically, the penis and clitoris respectively), and the anus is occasionally sealed.[citation needed]
Cluster headache (CH) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches on one side of the head, typically around the eye.[1] There are often accompanying autonomic symptoms during the headache such as eye watering, nasal congestion and swelling around the eye, typically confined to the side of the head with the pain.[1]
Coeliac disease, also spelled celiac disease, is an autoimmune disorder affecting primarily the small intestine that occurs in people who are genetically predisposed.[1] Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally. This often begins between six months and two years of age.[2] Non-classic symptoms are the most common, especially in people older than two years.[3][4][5] There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms.[2] Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;[3][6] however, it may develop at any age.[2][3] It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others.[6]
Cocaine dependence is a psychological desire to use cocaine regularly. Cocaine overdose may result in cardiovascular and brain damage, such as: constricting blood vessels in the brain, causing strokes and constricting arteries in the heart; causing heart attacks.[1]
Cocaine intoxication refers to the immediate and deleterious effects of cocaine on the body. Although cocaine intoxication and cocaine dependence can be present in the same individual, these syndromes present with different symptoms.
Coccidioidomycosis (/kɒkˌsɪdiɔɪdoʊmaɪˈkoʊsɪs/, kok-sid-ee-oy-doh-my-KOH-sis), commonly known as "cocci",[1] "Valley fever",[1] as well as "California fever",[2] "desert rheumatism",[2] and "San Joaquin Valley fever",[2] is a mammalian fungal disease caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii.[3] Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in certain parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and northern Mexico.[4]
Coffin–Lowry syndrome is a genetic disorder that is X-linked dominant and which causes severe mental problems sometimes associated with abnormalities of growth, cardiac abnormalities, kyphoscoliosis, as well as auditory and visual abnormalities.
Coffin–Siris Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes developmental delays and absent fifth finger and toe nails.
Cogan syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent inflammation of the front of the eye (the cornea) and often fever, fatigue, and weight loss, episodes of dizziness, and hearing loss. It can lead to deafness or blindness if untreated. The classic form of the disease was first described by D.G. Cogan in 1945.
Cohen syndrome (also known as Pepper syndrome or Cervenka syndrome, named after Michael Cohen, William Pepper and Jaroslav Cervenka, who researched the illness) is a genetic disorder.
Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high concentrations of circulating antibodies, usually IgM, directed against red blood cells.[1] It is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically one in which antibodies only bind red blood cells at low body temperatures, typically 28-31 °C.
Cold urticaria (essentially meaning "cold hives") is a disorder where hives (urticaria) or large red welts form on the skin after exposure to a cold stimulus.[1] The welts are usually itchy and often the hands and feet will become itchy and swollen as well. Hives vary in size from about 7mm in diameter to as big as about 27mm diameter or larger. The disease is classified as chronic when hives appear for longer than 6 weeks; they can last for life, though their course is often unpredictable. This disorder, or perhaps two disorders with the same clinical manifestations, can be inherited (familial cold urticaria) or acquired[2] (primary acquired cold urticaria). The acquired form is most likely to occur between ages 18–25, although it can occur as early as 5 years old in some cases.
Colitis (pl. colitides) is an inflammation of the colon.
Collagenous colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease affecting the colon specifically with peak incidence in the 5th decade of life, affecting women more than men. Its clinical presentation involves watery diarrhea in the absence of rectal bleeding. It is often classified under the umbrella entity microscopic colitis, that it shares with a related condition, lymphocytic colitis.[1]
Coloboma of optic nerve, is a rare defect of the optic nerve that causes moderate to severe visual field defects.
Color blindness, also known as color vision deficiency, is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color.[2] Color blindness can make some educational activities difficult. Buying fruit, picking clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging, for example. Problems, however, are generally minor and most people adapt. People with total color blindness, however, may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments.[2]
Colorado tick fever (CTF) (also called mountain tick fever, American tick fever, and American mountain tick fever) is a viral infection (Coltivirus) transmitted from the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). It should not be confused with the bacterial tick-borne infection, Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose.[2] The throat, sinuses, and voice box may also be affected.[3] Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure.[3] They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever.[4][5] People usually recover in seven to ten days.[4] Some symptoms may last up to three weeks.[6] In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.[4]
Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is an immune disorder characterized by recurrent infections and low antibody levels, specifically in immunoglobulin (Ig) types IgG, IgM and IgA.[1] Generally symptoms include high susceptibility to foreign invaders, chronic lung disease, and inflammation and infection of the gastrointestinal tract.[1] However, symptoms vary greatly between people. CVID is a lifelong disease.
Compartment syndrome is increased pressure within one of the body's compartments which contains muscles and nerves. Compartment syndrome most commonly occurs in compartments in the leg or arm. There are two main types of compartment syndrome: acute and chronic.
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a long term condition that often worsens with time. It is characterized by severe pain and sensitivity, swelling, and changes in the skin.[1] It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of people affected report symptoms throughout their whole body.[2]
Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder diagnosed in childhood or adolescence that presents itself through a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated. These behaviors are often referred to as "antisocial behaviors."[1] It is often seen as the precursor to antisocial personality disorder, which is not diagnosed until the individual is 18 years old.[2]
Conductive hearing loss occurs when there is a problem conducting sound waves anywhere along the route through the outer ear, tympanic membrane (eardrum), or middle ear (ossicles). This type of hearing loss may occur in conjunction with sensorineural hearing loss (mixed hearing loss) or alone.
Condylomata lata or condyloma latum, is a cutaneous condition characterized by wart-like lesions on the genitals.[1] They are generally symptoms of the secondary phase of syphilis, caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum.
A cone dystrophy is an inherited ocular disorder characterized by the loss of cone cells, the photoreceptors responsible for both central and color vision.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are any of several autosomal recessive diseases resulting from mutations of genes for enzymes mediating the biochemical steps of production of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids or sex steroids from cholesterol by the adrenal glands (steroidogenesis).[1]
11β-Hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (11β-OH CAH) is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11β-hydroxylase which mediates the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11β-OH CAH results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects. It also causes excessive androgen production both before and after birth and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting from a defect in the gene CYP17A1, which encodes for the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase. It produces decreased synthesis of both cortisol and sex steroids, with resulting increase in mineralocorticoid production. Thus, common symptoms include mild hypocortisolism, ambiguous genitalia in genetic males or failure of the ovaries to function at puberty in genetic females, and hypokalemic hypertension (respectively).[1] However, partial (incomplete) deficiency is notable for having inconsistent symptoms between patients,[2] and affected genetic (XX) females may be wholly asymptomatic except for infertility.[3]
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OH CAH), in all its forms, accounts for over 95% of diagnosed cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia,[1] and "CAH" in most contexts refers to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. An overview of the other types of CAH is presented in the main article.
3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (3β-HSD CAH) is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a mutation in the gene for one of the key enzymes in cortisol synthesis by the adrenal gland, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) type II (HSD3B2).[1][2] As a result, higher levels of 17OH-pregnenolone appear in the blood with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.
Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an endocrine disorder that is an uncommon and potentially lethal form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It arises from defects in the earliest stages of steroid hormone synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone—the first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol.
Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare, genetically inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally due to the lack of fibrinogen, a blood protein necessary for coagulation.[1] This disorder is autosomal recessive, meaning that two unaffected parents can have a child with the disorder.[2] The lack of fibrinogen expresses itself with excessive and, at times, uncontrollable bleeding.[3]
Congenital amputation is birth without a limb or limbs, or without a part of a limb or limbs.
Beals syndrome (congenital contractural arachnodactyly, Beals-Hecht syndrome) is a rare congenital connective tissue disorder. Beals syndrome has only recently[when?] been described as a syndrome distinct from Marfan's syndrome.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia; other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.
A congenital disorder of glycosylation (previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome) is one of several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation of a variety of tissue proteins and/or lipids is deficient or defective. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different organ systems (especially the nervous system, muscles, and intestines) in affected infants. The most common subtype is CDG-Ia (also referred to as PMM2-CDG) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate.
Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a rare blood disorder, similar to the thalassemias. CDA is one of many types of anemia, characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, and resulting from a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the body and a less than normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood.[1]
Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is an inherited form of myopathy with small type 1 muscle fibers that may occur in a number of neurological disorders.[1] It has a relatively good outcome and follows a stable course. [2] While the exact genetics is unclear there is an association with TPM3, ACTA1 and SEPN1 gene mutations.[3] It is a rare condition.[4]
Congenital hemolytic anemia (or hereditary hemolytic anemia) refers to hemolytic anemia which is primarily due to congenital disorders.[1]
Congenital hepatic fibrosis is an inherited fibrocystic liver disease associated with proliferation of interlobular bile ducts within the portal areas and fibrosis that do not alter hepatic lobular architecture. The fibrosis would affect resistance in portal veins leading to portal hypertension.
Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life.
Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), also called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, is an extremely rare inherited disorder of the nervous system which prevents the sensation of pain, heat, cold, or any real nerve-related sensations (including feeling the need to urinate); however, patients can still feel pressure. CIPA is the fourth type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), known as HSAN IV. (It is also referred to as HSAN Type IV). A person with CIPA cannot feel pain or differentiate even extreme temperatures. "Anhidrosis" means the body does not sweat, and "congenital" indicates that the condition is present from birth.
Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), also known as congenital lobar overinflation and infantile lobar emphysema,[1] is a neonatal condition associated with enlarged air spaces in the lungs of newborn children. It is usually diagnosed around the time of birth or in the first 6 months of life, occurring more often in boys than girls. CLE affects the upper lung lobes more than the lower lobes, and the left lung more often than the right lung. Although CLE may be caused by abnormal development of airways (bronchi, for example) or compression of airways by nearby tissues, no cause is identified in half of cases.[2]
Congenital myopathy is a very broad term for any muscle disorder present at birth. This defect primarily affects skeletal muscle fibres and causes muscular weakness and/or hypotonia. Congenital myopathies account for one of the top neuromuscular disorders in the world today, comprising approximately 6 in 100,000 live births every year.[1] As a whole, congenital myopathies can be broadly classified as follows:
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by protein in the urine and swelling of the body.
Congenital syphilis is syphilis present in utero and at birth, and occurs when a child is born to a mother with syphilis. Untreated early syphilis infections results in a high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, including saddle nose, lower extremity abnormalities, miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths, or death in neonates. Some infants with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth, but many develop symptoms later. Babies exposed, in utero, can have deformities, delays in development, or seizures along with many other problems such as rash, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and jaundice. Newborns will typically not develop a primary syphilitic chancre, but may present with signs of secondary syphilis (i.e. generalized body rash). Often these babies will develop syphilitic rhinitis ("snuffles"), the mucus from which is laden with the T. pallidum bacterium, and therefore highly infectious. Rarely, the symptoms of syphilis go unseen in infants so that they develop the symptoms of latent syphilis, including damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain.[1]
Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid.[1] It makes the eye appear pink or reddish. There may also be pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness. The affected eye may have increased tears or be "stuck shut" in the morning. Swelling of the white part of the eye may also occur.[2] Itching of the eye is more common in cases due to allergies.[3] Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.[2]
Conradi–Hünermann syndrome (also known as "Conradi–Hünermann–Happle syndrome",[1]:500 "Happle syndrome,"[2] and "X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata"[2]) is a type of chondrodysplasia punctata. It is associated with the gene EBP (gene)[3][4] and affects between one in 100,000 and one in 200,000 babies.
Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay. Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic). Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate. CDGP is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty.
Contact dermatitis is a type of inflammation of the skin.
Conversion disorder (CD) is a diagnostic category previously used in some psychiatric classification systems. It is sometimes applied to patients who present with neurological symptoms, such as numbness, blindness, paralysis, or fits, which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, and which cause significant distress. It is thought that these symptoms arise in response to stressful situations affecting a patient's mental health or an ongoing mental health condition such as depression. Conversion disorder was retained in DSM-5, but given the subtitle functional neurological symptom disorder. The new criteria cover the same range of symptoms, but remove the requirements for a psychological stressor to be present and for feigning to be disproved.
Cooks syndrome is a hereditary disorder which is characterized in the hands by bilateral nail hypoplasia on the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, absence of fingernails (anonychia) on the ring finger and little finger, lengthening of the thumbs, and bulbousness of the fingers. In the feet, it is characterized by absence of toenails and absence/hypoplasia of the distal phalanges.[1] In the second study of this disorder, it was found that the intermediate phalanges, proximal phalanges, and metacarpals were unaffected.[1]
Cor triatriatum (or triatrial heart) is a congenital heart defect where the left atrium (cor triatriatum sinistrum) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum) is subdivided by a thin membrane, resulting in three atrial chambers (hence the name). Cor triatriatum represents 0.1% of all congenital cardiac malformations and may be associated with other cardiac defects in as many as 50% of cases. The membrane may be complete or may contain one or more fenestrations of varying size. Cor triatrium sinistrum is more common. In this defect there is typically a proximal chamber that receives the pulmonic veins and a distal (true) chamber located more anteriorly where it empties into the mitral valve. The membrane that separates the atrium into two parts varies significantly in size and shape. It may appear similar to a diaphragm or be funnel-shaped, bandlike, entirely intact (imperforate) or contain one or more openings (fenestrations) ranging from small, restrictive-type to large and widely open.In the pediatric population, this anomaly may be associated with major congenital cardiac lesions such as tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, coarctation of the aorta, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, persistent left superior vena cava with unroofed coronary sinus, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal (endocardial cushion) defect, and common atrioventricular canal. Rarely, asplenia or polysplenia has been reported in these patients. In the adult, cor triatriatum is frequently an isolated finding.
Corneal dystrophy is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by bilateral abnormal deposition of substances in the transparent front part of the eye called the cornea.[1][2][3]
Corneodermatosseous syndrome (also known as "CDO syndrome") is an autosomal dominant condition with onset in infancy, characterized by corneal dystrophy, photophobia, diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, distal onycholysis, skeletal abnormalities, with brachydactyly, short stature, and medullary narrowing of digits.[1]
Coronary artery aneurysm is an abnormal dilatation of part of the coronary artery.
Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital abnormality of brain development where the neurons in an area of the brain failed to migrate in the proper formation in utero. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common cause of intractable epilepsy in children and is a frequent cause of epilepsy in adults. There are several subtypes of FCD including type 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 3c, each with distinct histopathological features.[1] All forms of focal cortical dysplasia lead to disorganization of the normal structure of the cerebral cortex. Type 1 FCD exhibits subtle alterations in cortical lamination. Type 2a FCD exhibits neurons that are larger than normal that are called cytomegalic dysmorphic neurons (CDN). FCD type 2b exhibits complete loss of laminar structure, and the presence of CDN and enlarged cells are called balloon cells (BC) for their large elliptical cell body shape, laterally displaced nucleus, and lack of dendrites or axons. The developmental origin of balloon cells is currently believed to be derived from neuronal or glial progenitor cells. Balloon cells are similar in structure to giant cells in the disorder tuberous sclerosis complex.
Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia.[1] CBD symptoms typically begin in people from 50–70 years of age, and the average disease duration is six years. It is characterized by marked disorders in movement and cognitive dysfunction, and is classified as one of the Parkinson plus syndromes. Clinical diagnosis is difficult, as symptoms of CBD are often similar to those of other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Due to the various clinical presentations associated with CBD, a final diagnosis can only be made upon neuropathologic examination.
Costello syndrome, also called faciocutaneoskeletal syndrome or FCS syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is characterized by delayed development and delayed mental progression, distinctive facial features, unusually flexible joints, and loose folds of extra skin, especially on the hands and feet.[1]:571 Heart abnormalities are common, including a very fast heartbeat (tachycardia), structural heart defects, and overgrowth of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Infants with Costello syndrome may be large at birth, but grow more slowly than other children and have difficulty feeding. Later in life, people with this condition have relatively short stature and many have reduced levels of growth hormones. It is a RASopathy.
Costochondritis, also known as chest wall pain, costosternal syndrome, or costosternal chondrodynia[1] is an acute[2] and often temporary inflammation of the costal cartilage, the structure that connects each rib to the sternum at the costosternal joint. The condition is a common cause of chest pain.[1][3][4] Though costochondritis often resolves on its own, it can be a recurring condition that has little or no signs of onset.[5]
Cowpox virus
A cramp is a sudden, involuntary muscle contraction or over-shortening; while generally temporary and non-damaging, they can cause mild-to-excruciating pain, and a paralysis-like immobility of the affected muscle(s). Onset is usually sudden, and it resolves on its own over a period of several seconds, minutes, or hours. Cramps may occur in a skeletal muscle or smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle cramps may be caused by muscle fatigue or a lack of electrolytes (e.g., low sodium, low potassium, or low magnesium, although the evidence has been mixed). Cramps of smooth muscle may be due to menstruation or gastroenteritis.
Cramp fasciculation syndrome (CFS) is a rare[1] peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder. It is more severe than the related (and common) disorder known as benign fasciculation syndrome; it causes fasciculations, cramps, pain, fatigue, and muscle stiffness similar to those seen in neuromyotonia (another related condition).[2] Patients with CFS, like those with neuromyotonia, may also experience paresthesias.[3] Most cases of cramp fasciculation syndrome are idiopathic.[4]
Crandall syndrome is a very rare congenital disorder characterised by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, hair loss associated with pili torti, and hypogonadism demonstrated through low levels of luteinising hormone and growth hormone. It is thought to be an autosomal recessive disorder closely related to Björnstad syndrome which presents similarly but without hypogonadism.[1]
Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia (also known as CDD or lionitis) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive bone disorder that causes calcium to build up in the skull, disfiguring the facial features and reducing life expectancy.
Craniofrontonasal dysplasia (craniofrontonasal syndrome, craniofrontonasal dysostosis, CFND) is a very rare X-linked malformation syndrome caused by mutations in the ephrin-B1 gene (EFNB1).[1][2] Phenotypic expression varies greatly amongst affected individuals, where females are more commonly and generally more severely affected than males.[1][2]
Craniosynostosis (from cranio, cranium; + syn, together; + ostosis relating to bone) is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone (ossification),[1] thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull.[2] Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it compensates by growing more in the direction parallel to the closed sutures.[2] Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features.[2] In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development combined with a significant reduction in IQ.[3]
CREST syndrome, also known as the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder. The acronym "CREST" refers to the five main features: calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.[1] It is associated with detectable antibodies against centromeres (a component of the cell nucleus), and usually spares the kidneys (a feature more common in the related condition systemic scleroderma). If the lungs are involved, it is usually in the form of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cretinism is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth owing to untreated congenital deficiency of thyroid hormone (congenital hypothyroidism) usually owing to maternal hypothyroidism.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is an incurable and universally fatal neurodegenerative disease.[2] CJD is at times called a human form of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE).[3] However, given that BSE is believed to be the cause of Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans, the two are often confused.[4]
Cri du chat syndrome, also known as chromosome 5p deletion syndrome, 5p− (said minus) syndrome or Lejeune’s syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder due to chromosome deletion on chromosome 5.[1] Its name is a French term (cat-cry or call of the cat) referring to the characteristic cat-like cry of affected children.[2] It was first described by Jérôme Lejeune in 1963.[3] The condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 live births across all ethnicities and is more common in females by a 4:3 ratio.[4]
Crigler–Najjar syndrome or CNS is a rare inherited disorder affecting the metabolism of bilirubin, a chemical formed from the breakdown of the heme in red blood cells. The disorder results in a form of nonhemolytic jaundice, which results in high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and often leads to brain damage in infants. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
The three most common sites of intestinal involvement in Crohn's disease are
Crome syndrome is a rare disease defined by various symptoms, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, eye and kidney problems. It usually causes death in 4 to 8 months.[1]
Cronkhite–Canada syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by multiple polyps of the digestive tract. It is sporadic (i.e. it does not seem to be a hereditary disease),[1] and it is currently considered acquired[2] and idiopathic (i.e. cause remains unknown).
Croup, also known as laryngotracheobronchitis, is a type of respiratory infection that is usually caused by a virus.[1] The infection leads to swelling inside the wind pipe, which interferes with normal breathing and produces the classic symptoms of "barking" cough, stridor, and a hoarse voice. Fever and runny nose may also be present.[1] These symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe.[2] Often it starts or is worse at night.[1][2] It normally lasts one to two days.[5]
Crouzon syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder known as a branchial arch syndrome. Specifically, this syndrome affects the first branchial (or pharyngeal) arch, which is the precursor of the maxilla and mandible. Since the branchial arches are important developmental features in a growing embryo, disturbances in their development create lasting and widespread effects.
Crouzonodermoskeletal syndrome is a disorder characterized by the premature joining of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis) during development and a skin condition called acanthosis nigricans.[1]
Cryoglobulinemia[1] or cryoglobulinaemia is a medical condition in which the blood contains large amounts of cryoglobulins – proteins (mostly immunoglobulins themselves) that become insoluble at reduced temperatures. This should be contrasted with cold agglutinins, which cause agglutination of red blood cells. Cryoglobulins typically precipitate at temperatures below normal body temperature (37 °C) and will dissolve again if the blood is heated. The precipitated clump can block blood vessels and cause toes and fingers to become gangrenous. Cryoglobulinemia can be associated with various diseases such as multiple myeloma and hepatitis C infection.[2] Cryoglobulins usually consist of IgM directed against the Fc region of IgG.[3]
Cryptococcosis, also known as cryptococcal disease, is a potentially fatal fungal disease. It is caused by one of two species; Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. These were all previously thought to be subspecies of C. neoformans but have now been identified as distinct species.
Cryptosporidiosis, also known as crypto,[1] is a parasitic disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough.[2] In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water;[2][3] recent evidence suggests that it can also be transmitted via fomites in respiratory secretions.[2]
Cushing's syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms due to prolonged exposure to cortisol.[2][3] Signs and symptoms may include: high blood pressure, abdominal obesity but with thin arms and legs, reddish stretch marks, a round red face, a fat lump between the shoulders, weak muscles, weak bones, acne, and fragile skin that heals poorly. Women may have more hair and irregular menstruation. Occasionally there may be changes in mood, headaches, and a chronic feeling of tiredness.[4]
Cutaneous larva migrans (abbreviated CLM) is a skin disease in humans, caused by the larvae of various nematode parasites of the hookworm family (Ancylostomatidae). The most common species causing this disease in the Americas is Ancylostoma braziliense. These parasites live in the intestines of dogs, cats, and wild animals and should not be confused with other members of the hookworm family for which humans are definitive hosts, namely Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus.
Cutis laxa (also known as Chalazoderma, Dermatochalasia, Dermatolysis, Dermatomegaly, Generalized elastolysis, Generalized elastorrhexis,[1] or Pachydermatocele[2]) is a group of rare connective tissue disorders in which the skin becomes inelastic and hangs loosely in folds.[3]
Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita or CMTC is a rare congenital vascular disorder that usually manifests in affecting the blood vessels of the skin. The condition was first recognised and described in 1922 by Cato van Lohuizen,[1] a Dutch pediatrician whose name was later adopted in the other common name used to describe the condition - Van Lohuizen Syndrome. CMTC is also used synonymously with congenital generalized phlebectasia, nevus vascularis reticularis, congenital phlebectasia, livedo telangiectatica, congenital livedo reticularis and Van Lohuizen syndrome.[2]
Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG) is a superficial medical condition usually associated with thickening of the scalp.[1] The condition was first reported by Alibert in 1837,[2] who called it cutis sulcata.[3] A clinical description of the condition was provided by Robert[who?] in 1843[4] and was named by Unna in 1907.[5] It has also been called Robert-Unna syndrome, bulldog scalp, corrugated skin, cutis verticis plicata, and pachydermia verticis gyrata.[6]
Cyanide poisoning is poisoning that results from exposure to a number of forms of cyanide.[2] Early symptoms include headache, dizziness, fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and vomiting. This may then be followed by seizures, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and cardiac arrest.[3] Onset of symptoms is usually within a few minutes.[3][4] If a person survives there may be long term neurological problems.[3]
Cyclic neutropenia (or cyclical neutropenia) is a form of neutropenia, a white blood cell deficiency, that tends to occur every three weeks and lasts three to six days at a time due to changing rates of cell production by the bone marrow.[1]
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (US English) or cyclical vomiting syndrome (UK English) (CVS) is a chronic functional condition of unknown etiology characterised by recurring attacks of intense nausea, vomiting, and sometimes abdominal pain, headaches, or migraines. CVS typically develops during childhood, usually between ages 3 and 7; although it often remits during adolescence, it can persist into adult life.[1][2][3]
Cyclothymia (/ˌsaɪkloʊˈθaɪmiə/), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a type of chronic mood disorder widely considered to be a more chronic but milder or subthreshold form of bipolar disorder. Cyclothymia is characterized by numerous mood swings, with periods of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomanic episode,[1] alternating with periods of mild or moderate symptoms of depression that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine.[1][2] Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs and symptoms may include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and infertility in males. Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.[1]
A cystic hygroma, also known as cystic lymphangioma and macrocystic lymphatic malformation, is an often congenital multiloculated lymphatic lesion that can arise anywhere, but is classically found in the left posterior triangle of the neck and armpits. This is the most common form of lymphangioma. It contains large cyst-like cavities containing lymph, a watery fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Microscopically, cystic hygroma consists of multiple locules filled with lymph. In the depth, the locules are quite big but they decrease in size towards the surface.
Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine.[1] It is a genetic disorder that typically follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Cystinosis is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in the pediatric age group. Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells in renal tubules are impaired, leading to abnormal amounts of carbohydrates and amino acids in the urine, excessive urination, and low blood levels of potassium and phosphates.
Cystinuria is an inherited autosomal recessive[1] disease that is characterized by high concentrations of the amino acid cystine in the urine, leading to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, ureter, and bladder. It is a type of aminoaciduria.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (from the Greek cyto-, "cell", and megalo-, "large") is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. Humans and monkeys serve as natural hosts. There are currently eight species in this genus including the type species, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, human herpesvirus 5, HHV-5), which is the species that infects humans. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include glandular fever, and pneumonia.[2][3] In the medical literature, most mentions of CMV without further specification refer implicitly to human CMV. Human CMV is the most studied of all cytomegaloviruses.[4]
Dahlberg Borer Newcomer syndrome is a rare autosomal X-linked recessive genetic condition characterized by a prolapse of the bicuspid valve, progressive kidney failure, congenital lymphedema, hypoparathyroidism, and very short end bones of fingers.[1] Treatment for this condition is based on its symptoms. These treatments may include manual lymphatic drainage, consumption of beta blockers or anticoagulants for the bicuspid valve prolapse and vitamin D or calcium carbonate tablets for the hypoparathyroidism.[2]
Dandy–Walker syndrome (DWS) is a rare group of congenital human brain malformations. There are three subtypes which affect multiple organs to varying degrees, but the fundamental abnormalities involve the cerebellum[1] which controls muscle coordination. The adjacent fourth ventricle is often affected which can alter the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, increase intracranial pressure, and lead to multiple other brain function problems. The degree of disability varies but is typically lifelong. Treatment may involve physical therapy, special education, or surgical placement of a cerebral shunt. It is named for Walter Dandy and Arthur Earl Walker.[2][3]
Darier's disease (DAR), also known as Darier disease, Darier–White disease,[1] Dyskeratosis follicularis[1] and Keratosis follicularis,[2]:523[3]:567 is an autosomal dominant disorder discovered by French dermatologist Ferdinand-Jean Darier. Darier's is characterized by dark crusty patches on the skin, sometimes containing pus. The crusty patches are also known as keratotic papules, keratosis follicularis or dyskeratosis follicularis.[4][5]
De Barsy syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Symptoms include cutis laxa (loose hanging skin) as well as other eye, musculoskeletal, and neurological abnormalities.[1] It is usually progressive, manifesting side effects that can include clouded corneas, cataracts, short stature, dystonia, or progeria (premature aging).[2]
DeSanctis–Cacchione syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by the skin and eye symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) occurring in association with microcephaly, progressive mental retardation, retarded growth and sexual development, deafness, choreoathetosis, ataxia and quadriparesis.[1]
Decompression sickness (DCS; also known as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as working in a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft.
Deep vein thrombosis, or deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein,[a] most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.
Degos disease (also called malignant atrophic papulosis) is a rare vasculopathy that affects the lining of the medium and small veins and arteries, resulting in occlusion (blockage of the vessel) and tissue infarction.[1]
Dejerine–Sottas disease, also known as Dejerine–Sottas syndrome, Dejerine–Sottas neuropathy, progressive hypertrophic interstitial polyneuropathy of childhood and onion bulb neuropathy[1] (and, hereditary motor and sensory polyneuropathy type III and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 3), is a hereditary neurological disorder characterised by damage to the peripheral nerves and resulting progressive muscle wasting. The condition is caused by mutations in a various genes and currently has no known cure.[2]
Delayed ejaculation, also called retarded ejaculation or inhibited ejaculation, is a man's inability for or persistent difficulty in achieving orgasm, despite typical sexual desire and sexual stimulation. Generally, a man can reach orgasm within a few minutes of active thrusting during sexual intercourse, whereas a man with delayed ejaculation either does not have orgasms at all or cannot have an orgasm until after prolonged intercourse which might last for 30–45 minutes or more.[1] In most cases delayed ejaculation presents the condition in which the man can climax and ejaculate only during masturbation, but not during sexual intercourse. It is the least common of the male sexual dysfunctions, and can result as a side effect of some medications. In one survey, 8% of men reported being unable to achieve orgasm over a 2-month period or longer in the previous year.[2]
Delirium, or acute confusional state, is an organically caused decline from a previously attained baseline level of cognitive function. It is typified by fluctuating course, attentional deficits and generalized severe disorganization of behavior. It typically involves other cognitive deficits, changes in arousal (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), perceptual deficits, altered sleep-wake cycle, and psychotic features such as hallucinations and delusions.
Delirium tremens (DTs) is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days. People may also see or hear things other people do not.[1] Physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating.[2] Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death.[1] Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs to withdraw from.[3]
Delusional disorder is a mental illness in which the patient presents with delusions, but with no accompanying prominent hallucinations, thought disorder, mood disorder, or significant flattening of affect.[1][2] Delusions are a specific symptom of psychosis. Delusions can be "bizarre" or "non-bizarre" in content;[2] non-bizarre delusions are fixed false beliefs that involve situations that could potentially occur in real life, such as being followed or poisoned.[3] Apart from their delusions, people with delusional disorder may continue to socialize and function in a normal manner and their behavior does not generally seem odd.[4] However, the preoccupation with delusional ideas can be disruptive to their overall lives.[4] For the diagnosis to be made, auditory and visual hallucinations cannot be prominent, though olfactory or tactile hallucinations related to the content of the delusion may be present.[2]
Dementia, also known as senility,[1] is a broad category of brain diseases that cause a long term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember that is great enough to affect a person's daily functioning.[2] Other common symptoms include emotional problems, problems with language, and a decrease in motivation.[2][3] A person's consciousness is usually not affected.[2] A dementia diagnosis requires a change from a person's usual mental functioning and a greater decline than one would expect due to aging.[2][4] These diseases also have a significant effect on a person's caregivers.[2]
Familial British dementia is a form of dementia. It was first reported by Cecil Charles Worster-Drought in 1933 [1] and is therefore also known as Worster-Drought syndrome. It is caused by a mutation in the ITM2B gene (also known as BRI2); a different mutation of the same gene causes the similar syndrome of familial Danish dementia. The combination of amyloid pathology and neurofibrillary tangles has led to comparison with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.[2]
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal and/or temporal lobes, and typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact.[1]
Dementia pugilistica (DP) is a type of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease with features of dementia. DP may affect amateur or professional boxers, wrestlers as well as athletes in other sports who suffer concussions. DP is also called chronic boxer's encephalopathy, traumatic boxer’s encephalopathy, boxer's dementia, chronic traumatic brain injury associated with boxing (CTBI-B), and punch-drunk syndrome. DP was historically considered equivalent to CTE but is now considered a subtype of CTE.[citation needed]
Vascular dementia, also known as multi-infarct dementia (MID) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), is dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain, typically a series of minor strokes, leading to worsening cognitive decline that occurs step by step.[1] The term refers to a syndrome consisting of a complex interaction of cerebrovascular disease and risk factors that lead to changes in the brain structures due to strokes and lesions, and resulting changes in cognition. The temporal relationship between a stroke and cognitive deficits is needed to make the diagnosis.[2]
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a type of dementia that worsens over time.[1][2] Additional symptoms may include fluctuations in alertness, seeing things that other people do not, slowness of movement, trouble walking, and rigidity.[1] Excessive movement during sleep and mood changes such as depression are also common.[3]
A demyelinating disease is any disease of the nervous system in which the myelin sheath of neurons is damaged.[1] This damage impairs the conduction of signals in the affected nerves. In turn, the reduction in conduction ability causes deficiency in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves are involved.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[2]
Dental fluorosis (also termed mottled enamel)[1] is an extremely common[2] disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation.[3]
Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degeneration caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine tract in the atrophin-1 protein.[1] It is also known as Haw River Syndrome and Naito-Oyanagi disease. Although this condition was perhaps first described by Smith et al. in 1958, and several sporadic cases have been reported from Western countries, this disorder seems to be very rare except in Japan.
Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) is a genetic disorder of tooth development. This condition is a type of dentin dysplasia that causes teeth to be discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent giving teeth an opalescent sheen.[1] Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (deciduous) teeth and permanent teeth. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Dentinogenesis imperfecta affects an estimated 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 people.
Dependent personality disorder (DPD), formerly known as asthenic personality disorder, is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. This personality disorder is a long-term condition in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence.
Depersonalization disorder (DPD), also known as depersonalization-derealization syndrome, is a mental disorder in which the person has persistent or recurrent feelings of depersonalization and/or derealization. Symptoms can be classified as either depersonalization or derealization. Depersonalization is described as feeling disconnected or estranged from one's self. Individuals experiencing depersonalization may report feeling as if they are an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions.[1] In some cases, individuals may be unable to accept their reflection as their own, or they may have out-of-body experiences.[2] While depersonalization is a sense of detachment from one's self, derealization is described as detachment from one's surroundings. Individuals experiencing derealization may report perceiving the world around them as foggy, dreamlike/surreal, or visually distorted.[1] In addition to these depersonalization-derealization disorder symptoms, the inner turmoil created by the disorder can result in depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, phobias, etc. It can also cause a variety of physical symptoms, including chest pain, blurry vision, visual snow, nausea, and the sensation of pins and needles in one's arms or legs.
Depressive personality disorder (also known as melancholic personality disorder) is a controversial psychiatric diagnosis that denotes a personality disorder with depressive features.
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), or Duhring's disease,[1][2] is a chronic blistering skin condition,[3] characterised by blisters filled with a watery fluid.[4] Despite its name, DH is neither related to nor caused by herpes virus: the name means that it is a skin inflammation having an appearance similar to herpes.
Dermatographic urticaria (also known as dermographism, dermatographism or "skin writing") is a skin disorder and one of the most common types of urticaria affecting 4–5% of the population.[1][2]
Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare connective-tissue disease related to polymyositis (PM) that is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and the skin. While DM most frequently affects the skin and muscles, it is a systemic disorder that may also affect the joints, the esophagus, the lungs, and the heart.[1]
Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR), also known as dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis hyperkeratotica et mutilans, dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis hypohidotica et atrophica and dermatopathic pigmentosa reticularis,[1]:511 is a rare, autosomal dominant[2] congenital disorder that is a form of ectodermal dysplasia. Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis is composed of the triad of generalized reticulate hyperpigmentation, noncicatricial alopecia, and onychodystrophy.[3]:856
Dermatophytosis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin.[1] Typically it results in a red, itchy, scaly, circular rash. Hair loss may occur in the area affected. Symptoms begin four to fourteen days after exposure.[2] Multiple areas can be affected at a given time.[3]
Dermoodontodysplasia is dental problems, trichodysplasia, and nail and skin problems.[1]
Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy is a subgroup of the myofibrillar myopathy diseases and is the result of a mutation in the gene that codes for desmin which prevents it from forming protein filaments, instead forming aggregates of desmin and other proteins throughout the cell.[1][2]
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD),[1][2][3][4][5] also known as developmental dyspraxia or simply dyspraxia,[6][7][8][9] is a chronic neurological disorder beginning in childhood that can affect planning of movements and co-ordination as a result of brain messages not being accurately transmitted to the body. Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed in the absence of other neurological impairments like cerebral palsy,[10] muscular dystrophy,[6] multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. It affects 5 to 6 percent of school-aged children.[11] This disorder progresses to adulthood, therefore making it a lifelong condition.
Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence.[2][3] Different people are affected to varying degrees.[4] Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.[4][5] Often these difficulties are first noticed at school.[6] When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia.[4] The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn.[4]
Dextrocardia (from Latin dexter, meaning "right," and Greek kardia, meaning "heart") is a rare congenital defect in which the apex of the heart is located on the right side of the body.[1] There are two main types of dextrocardia: dextrocardia of embryonic arrest (also known as isolated dextrocardia[citation needed]) and dextrocardia situs inversus. Dextrocardia situs inversus is further divided.
D-Glyceric Acidemia (a.k.a. D-Glyceric Aciduria) is an inherited disease, in the category of inborn errors of metabolism. It is caused by a mutation in the gene GLYCTK, which encodes for the enzyme glycerate kinase.
Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of severely dilute urine, with reduction of fluid intake having no effect on the concentration of the urine.[1]
Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic diseases in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.[2] Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.[3] Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar coma, or death.[4] Serious long-term complications include heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney failure, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.[3]
Diabetes mellitus type 1 (also known as type 1 diabetes) is a form of diabetes mellitus in which not enough insulin is produced.[4] The lack of insulin results in high blood sugar levels.[1] The classical symptoms are frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, and weight loss.[4] Additional symptoms may include blurry vision, feeling tired, and poor healing.[2] Symptoms typically develop over a short period of time.[1]
Diabetes mellitus type 2 (also known as type 2 diabetes) is a long term metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.[3] Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss. Symptoms may also include increased hunger, feeling tired, and sores that do not heal.[4] Often symptoms come on slowly.[3] Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, strokes, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations.[1] The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.[5][6]
Diabetic angiopathy is a form of angiopathy associated with diabetes mellitus. While not exclusive, the two most common forms are Diabetic retinopathy and Diabetic nephropathy, whose pathophysiologies are largely identical.
Diabetic nephropathy (or diabetic kidney disease[1]) is a progressive kidney disease caused by damage to the capillaries in the kidneys' glomeruli.[2] It is characterized by nephrotic syndrome and diffuse scarring of the glomeruli. It is due to longstanding diabetes mellitus, and is a prime reason for dialysis in many developed countries. It is classified as a small blood vessel complication of diabetes.[3]
Diabetic neuropathies are nerve damaging disorders associated with diabetes mellitus. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum) in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.
Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA), also known as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, inherited pure red cell aplasia[1] and as inherited erythroblastopenia,[2] is a congenital erythroid aplasia that usually presents in infancy.[3] DBA causes low red blood cell counts (anemia), without substantially affecting the other blood components (the platelets and the white blood cells), which are usually normal. This is in contrast to Shwachman–Bodian–Diamond syndrome, in which the bone marrow defect results primarily in neutropenia, and Fanconi anemia, where all cell lines are affected resulting in pancytopenia.
Diastematomyelia (occasionally diastomyelia) is a congenital disorder in which a part of the spinal cord is split, usually at the level of the upper lumbar vertebra.
Diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) is an autosomal recessive[1] dysplasia which affects cartilage and bone development. ("Diastrophism" is a general word referring to a twisting.)[2] Diastrophic dysplasia is due to mutations in the SLC26A2 gene.
Diencephalic syndrome, diencephalic syndrome of emaciation or Russell's syndrome is a rare neurological disorder seen in infants and children and characterised by failure to thrive and severe emaciation despite normal or slightly decreased caloric intake, locomotor hyperactivity, and euphoria. Less commonly it may involve skin pallor without anaemia, hypoglycaemia, and hypotension.[1] The syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal cause of failure to thrive in children. Failure to thrive presents on average at 7 months of age.[1] Of note the syndrome is not associated with developmental delay.[2] There may be associated hydrocephalus.
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a non-inflammatory spondyloarthropathy of the spine. It is characterized by spiny ankylosis and enthesopathy (ossification of the ligaments and entheses). It most commonly affects the thoracic and thoraco-lumbar spine, but involvement is variable and can include the entire spine.[1] The disc spaces, facet and sacroiliac joints remain unaffected. Diagnosis requires confluent ossification of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies.[1] Classically, advanced disease may have "melted candle wax" appearance along the spine on radiographic studies.[2]
Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a potentially fatal disorder with multiple cutaneous and systemic hemangiomas.[1] The most common site of internal organ involvement is the liver. Death can result from high-output cardiac failure as a result of arteriovenous shunting. Early detection and treatment with steroids results in most patients remaining healthy, with serious problems developing for some patients during the hemangiomas growth phase.[2]
Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an inflammatory lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, an inflammatory condition of the bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), or diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD),[1] is a group of lung diseases affecting the interstitium (the tissue and space around the air sacs of the lungs).[2] It concerns alveolar epithelium, pulmonary capillary endothelium, basement membrane, perivascular and perilymphatic tissues. It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage. But in interstitial lung disease, the repair process goes awry and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.
DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,[7][8] is a syndrome caused by the deletion of a small segment of chromosome 22.[9][10] It is a common genetic disorder resulting in medical complications, cognitive impairment, and brain morphologic changes.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (DPD deficiency) is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder in which there is absent or significantly decreased activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of uracil and thymine.
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems.
Diphallia, penile duplication (PD), diphallic terata, or diphallasparatus, is a rare developmental abnormality in which a male infant is born with two penises. The first reported case was by Johannes Jacob Wecker in 1609.[1][2] Its occurrence is 1 in 5.5 million boys in the United States.[3]
Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.[1] Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe.[2] They usually start two to five days after exposure.[1] Symptoms often come on fairly gradually beginning with a sore throat and fever.[2] In severe cases a grey or white patch develops in the throat.[1][2] This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup.[2] The neck may swell in part due to large lymph nodes.[1] A form of diphtheria that involves the skin, eyes, or genitals also exists.[1][2] Complications may include myocarditis, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low blood platelets. Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis.[1]
Diplopia, commonly known as double vision, is the simultaneous perception of two images of a single object that may be displaced horizontally, vertically, diagonally (i.e., both vertically and horizontally), or rotationally in relation to each other.[1] It is usually the result of impaired function of the extraocular muscles (EOMs), where both eyes are still functional but they cannot turn to target the desired object.[2] Problems with EOMs may be due to mechanical problems, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, disorders of the cranial nerves (III, IV, and VI) that stimulate the muscles, and occasionally disorders involving the supranuclear oculomotor pathways or ingestion of toxins.[3]

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic skin condition of sores with inflammation and scarring favoring the face, ears, and scalp and at times on other body areas. These lesions develop as a red, inflamed patch with a scaling and crusty appearance. The center areas may appear lighter in color with a rim darker than the normal skin.
Disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood (DAD) according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), is defined as:
Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, also known as dissecting scalp cellulitis, dissecting folliculitis of the scalp, perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens of Hoffman, perifolliculitis abscedens et suffodiens, or folliculitis abscedens et suffodiens, is an inflammatory condition of the scalp that can lead to scarring alopecia, which begins with deep inflammatory nodules, primarily over occiput, that progresses to coalescing regions of boggy scalp. Boggy tissue has a high fluid level that results in a spongy feeling. Isotretinoin proves to be the medicine of choice for the treatment of the disease. [1] [2]:649[3]:761[4]
Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD),[1] is a mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately show in a person's behavior, accompanied by memory impairment for important information not explained by ordinary forgetfulness. These symptoms are not accounted for by substance abuse, seizures, other medical conditions, nor by imaginative play in children.[2] Diagnosis is often difficult as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders. Malingering should be considered if there is possible financial or forensic gain, as well as factitious disorder if help-seeking behavior is prominent.[2][3][4][5]
Diverticulitis is a digestive disease in which pouches within the large bowel wall become inflamed.[1] Symptoms typically include lower abdominal pain of a sudden onset. Onset however may also occur over a few days.[1] In North America and Europe pain is usually on the left side, while in Asia it is often on the right.[2][3] There may also be fever, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, or blood in the stool.[1] Repeated attacks may occur.[2]
Diverticulosis is the condition of having diverticula in the colon that are not inflamed. These are outpockets of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through weaknesses of muscle layers in the colon wall. They typically cause no symptoms.[1] Diverticular disease occurs when diverticula become inflamed, known as diverticulitis, or bleed.[2]
DOOR (Deafness, Onychdystrophy, Osteodystrophy, and Mental Retardation) Syndrome is a genetic disease which is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. DOOR syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, sensorineural deafness, abnormal nails and phalanges of the hands and feet, and variable seizures. A similar deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and has no mental retardation. Some authors have proposed that it may be the same as Eronen Syndrome, but since both disorders are extremely rare it is hard to make a determination.[1]
Dopamine beta (β)-hydroxylase deficiency (DβH deficiency) is a condition involving inadequate Dopamine beta-hydroxylase. It is characterized by increased amounts of serum dopamine and the absence of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine. Dopamine is released, as a false neurotransmitter, in place of norepinephrine. Other names for norepinephrine include noradrenaline (NA) and noradrenalin. This condition is also sometimes referred to as "Norepinephrine deficiency.” Researchers of disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and migraines are very interested in studying this disorder, as patients with these specific diseases generally have a threefold increase in the amount of dopamine in their system and yet are generally normal. This is in contrast to patients with DβH deficiency.
Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a form of congenital heart disease where both of the great arteries connect (in whole or in part) to the right ventricle (RV). In some cases it is found that this occurs on the left side of the heart rather than the right side.
Down syndrome (DS or DNS), also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.[1] It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability.[2] The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely.[3]
Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an infection by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae.[1] Initially there are no symptoms.[2] About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on the lower limb.[1] The worm then comes out of the skin over the course of a few weeks.[3] During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work.[2] It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.[1]
Duane syndrome is a congenital rare type of strabismus most commonly characterized by the inability of the eye to move outwards. The syndrome was first described by ophthalmologists Jakob Stilling (1887) and Siegmund Türk (1896), and subsequently named after Alexander Duane, who discussed the disorder in more detail in 1905.[1]
Dubin–Johnson syndrome (DJS) is a rare, autosomal recessive, benign disorder that causes an isolated increase of conjugated bilirubin in the serum. Classically, the condition causes a black liver due to the deposition of a pigment similar to melanin.[1] This condition is associated with a defect in the ability of hepatocytes to secrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile, and is similar to Rotor syndrome. It is usually asymptomatic, but may be diagnosed in early infancy based on laboratory tests. No treatment is usually needed.[1]
Dubowitz syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation and a characteristic facial appearance (small, round, triangular shaped with a pointed, receding chin, a broad, wide-tipped nose, and wide-set eyes with drooping eyelids). Symptoms vary among patients, but other characteristics include a soft, high pitched voice; partial webbing of fingers and toes; palate deformations; genital abnormalities; eczema; hyperactivity; preference for concrete thinking over abstract; language difficulties and aversion to crowds.[1] The pathogenesis of the disease is yet to be identified and no medical tests can definitively diagnose the disease.[2] The main method of diagnosis is through identification of facial phenotype. Since it was first described in 1965 by English physician Victor Dubowitz, over 140 cases have been reported worldwide. Although the majority of cases have been reported from the United States, Germany and Russia, the disorder appears to affect both genders and all ethnicities equally.[1]
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy.[1] The symptom of muscle weakness usually begin around the age of four in boys and worsens quickly.[2] Typically muscle loss occurs first in the upper legs and pelvis followed by those of the upper arms. This can result in trouble standing up.[1] Most are unable to walk by the age of 12.[2] Affected muscles may look larger due to increased fat content. Scoliosis is also common. Some may have intellectual disability. Females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms.[1]
Duodenal atresia, also known as duodenojejunal atresia, is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum. It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy (polyhydramnios) and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. Radiography shows a distended stomach and distended duodenum, which are separated by the pyloric valve, a finding described as the double-bubble sign.
Dupuytren's contracture (also known as Dupuytren's disease, or by the slang term "Viking disease")[1] is a flexion contracture of the hand due to a palmar fibromatosis,[2] in which the fingers bend towards the palm and cannot be fully extended (straightened). It is an inherited proliferative connective tissue disorder that involves the hand's palmar fascia.[3] It is named after Baron Guillaume Dupuytren, the surgeon who described an operation to correct the affliction.
Dwarfism occurs when an organism is short in stature from a medical condition that caused slow growth. In humans, dwarfism is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than 4 feet 10 inches (58 in; 147 cm).[1] Dwarfism can be caused by more than 300 medical conditions,[2] such that the symptoms of individuals with dwarfism vary greatly. Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by one or more body parts being relatively large or small in comparison to those of an average-sized adult, with growth variations in specific areas. In cases of proportionate dwarfism, the body appears normally proportioned, but is unusually small. Low muscle tone is common, but intelligence and lifespan are usually normal.
Dysautonomia is a term for a group of diseases that include postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), multiple system atrophy, autonomic failure, and autonomic neuropathy. In these conditions the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. Dysautonomia is most often a type of neuropathy affecting the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the heart, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, pupils, and blood vessels; although it has many causes, not all of which classify as neuropathic.[1]
Dysbarism refers to medical conditions resulting from changes in ambient pressure.[citation needed] Various activities are associated with pressure changes. underwater diving is the most frequently cited example, but pressure changes also affect people who work in other pressurized environments (for example, caisson workers), and people who move between different altitudes.
Dyscalculia (/ˌdɪskælˈkjuːli.ə/)[1][2][3][4] is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic, such as difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, and learning facts in mathematics. It is generally seen as a specific developmental disorder.
Dysferlinopathy is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of functional dysferlin protein due to mutations in the dysferlin gene.[1][2] Dysferlinopathy is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and is most often clinically diagnosed as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) or Miyoshi muscular dystrophy 1 (MMD1; a type of distal muscular dystrophy), depending on the initial pattern of muscle involvement at diagnosis.[3] Dysferlinopathy is a rare disease, the exact incidence of which has not yet been determined.
A dysgerminoma is a type of germ cell tumor;[1] it usually is malignant and usually occurs in the ovary.
Dysgraphia is a deficiency in the ability to write, primarily handwriting, but also coherence.[1] Dysgraphia is a transcription disability, meaning that it is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting, orthographic coding (orthography, the storing process of written words and processing the letters in those words), and finger sequencing (the movement of muscles required to write).[2] It often overlaps with other learning disabilities such as speech impairment, attention deficit disorder, or developmental coordination disorder.[3] In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), dysgraphia is characterized as a learning disability in the category of written expression when one’s writing skills are below those expected given a person’s age measured through intelligence and age-appropriate education. The DSM is not clear in whether or not writing refers only to the motor skills involved in writing, or if it also includes orthographic skills and spelling.[3]
Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), also called Zinsser-Cole-Engman syndrome,[1][2]:570 is a rare progressive congenital disorder with a highly variable phenotype.[3] The entity was classically defined by the triad of abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia of the oral mucosa, but these components do not always occur.[3] DKC is characterized by short telomeres. Some of the manifestations resemble premature aging (similar to progeria). The disease initially mainly affects the skin, but a major consequence is progressive bone marrow failure which occurs in over 80%, causing early mortality.[3]
Dyskinesia refers to a category of movement disorders that are characterized by involuntary muscle movements,[1] including movements similar to tics or chorea and diminished voluntary movements.[2] Dyskinesia can be anything from a slight tremor of the hands to an uncontrollable movement of the upper body or lower extremities. Discoordination can also occur internally especially with the respiratory muscles and it often goes unrecognized.[3] Dyskinesia is a symptom of several medical disorders that are distinguished by their underlying cause.
A dysostosis is a disorder of the development of bone, in particular affecting ossification.[1]
Dyspareunia is painful sexual intercourse due to medical or psychological causes. The pain can primarily be on the external surface of the genitalia, or deeper in the pelvis upon deep pressure against the cervix. It can affect a small portion of the vulva or vagina or be felt all over the surface. Understanding the duration, location, and nature of the pain is important in identifying the causes of the pain.
Dysplasia (from Ancient Greek δυσ- dys-, "bad" or "difficult" and πλάσις plasis, "formation") is an ambiguous term used in pathology to refer to an abnormality of development or an epithelial anomaly of growth and differentiation (epithelial dysplasia).[1]
Dysplastic nevus syndrome (also known as "Atypical Mole Syndrome (AMS)", "Familial atypical multiple mole–melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome", "familial melanoma syndrome,"[1] and "B-K mole syndrome") is a cutaneous condition described in certain families, and characterized by unusual nevi and multiple inherited melanomas.[2]:692[3]
Dysthymia, also called neurotic depression,[1] dysthymic disorder, or chronic depression, is a mood disorder consisting of the same cognitive and physical problems as in depression, with less severe but longer-lasting symptoms.[2][3] The concept was coined by Robert Spitzer as a replacement for the term "depressive personality" in the late 1970s.[4]
Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder syndrome in which sustained or repetitive muscle contractions result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal fixed postures.[1] The movements may resemble a tremor. Dystonia is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles.[2]
Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.[1] The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent.[1] This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.[2]
ECHO virus
Ectodermal dysplasia is not a single disorder, but a group of syndromes all deriving from abnormalities of the ectodermal structures.[1]:570 More than 150 different syndromes have been identified.[2]
Ectopia cordis (Greek: "away / out of place" + Latin: "heart") is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside of the thorax. The ectopic heart can be found along a spectrum of anatomical locations, including the neck, chest, or abdomen. In most cases, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum.[1]
Ectopia lentis is a displacement or malposition of the eye's crystalline lens from its normal location. A partial dislocation of a lens is termed lens subluxation or subluxated lens; a complete dislocation of a lens is termed lens luxation or luxated lens.
Ectopic pregnancy, also known as eccyesis or tubal pregnancy, is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus.[1] Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Less than 50 percent of women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred.[2] Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock.[1][2] With very rare exceptions the fetus is unable to survive.[3]
Ectrodactyly, split hand, cleft hand,[1] derived from the Greek ektroma (abortion) and daktylos (finger)[2] involves the deficiency or absence of one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM).[3] The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as "claw-like" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a syndactyly of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.[4]
Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, and also referred to as EEC syndrome[1] (also known as "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome"[2]:520) is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait.[3]:571 EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts.[4] Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections,[5] obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct,[6] decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.[7][8]
Edwards syndrome, also known as trisomy 18, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all, or part of a third copy of chromosome 18. Many parts of the body are affected. Babies are often born small and have heart defects. Other features include a small head, small jaw, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and severe intellectual disability.[2]
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of genetic connective tissue disorders.[1] Symptoms can vary from mildly loose joints to life-threatening complications such as aortic dissection.[1] Chronic pain or early osteoarthritis may also occur.[2]
Ehrlichiosis is a tickborne[1] bacterial infection,[2] caused by bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae, genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma. These obligate intracellular bacteria infect and kill white blood cells.
Eiken syndrome is a rare[1] autosomal bone dysplasia with a skeletal phenotype which has been described in a unique consanguineous family, where it segregates as a recessive trait.[2][3]
Elective mutism was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while selective mutism is considered to be a failure to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with social anxiety disorder. In contrast to selective mutism, someone who is electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies. Elective mutism is often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma.
Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, and also referred to as EEC syndrome[1] (also known as "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome"[2]:520) is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait.[3]:571 EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts.[4] Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections,[5] obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct,[6] decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.[7][8]
Elejalde syndrome (also known as "Griscelli syndrome type 1") is a extremely rare autosomal recessive syndrome (only around 10 cases known) consisting of moderate pigment dilution, profound primary neurologic defects, no immune defects, and hair with metallic silvery sheen.[1][2]
Elephantiasis is a symptom of a variety of diseases, where parts of a person's body swell to massive proportions.
Ellis–van Creveld Syndrome (also called chondroectodermal dysplasia or mesoectodermal dysplasia but see 'Nomenclature' section below) is a rare genetic disorder of the skeletal dysplasia type.

Emetophobia is a phobia that causes overwhelming, intense anxiety pertaining to vomiting. This specific phobia can also include subcategories of what causes the anxiety, including a fear of vomiting in public, a fear of seeing vomit, a fear of watching the action of vomiting or fear of being nauseated.[1] It is common for emetophobics to be underweight, or even anorexic, due to strict diets and restrictions they make for themselves. The thought of someone possibly vomiting can cause the phobic person to engage in extreme behaviors to escape the perceived (and sometimes very real) threat of that particular situation, in which the phobic person will go to great lengths to avoid even potential situations that could even be perceived as "threatening".
Empty sella syndrome (abbreviated ESS) is where the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened,[1] filling the sella turcica, or "Turkish Saddle", with cerebrospinal fluid on imaging instead of the normal pituitary. ESS can be found in the radiological workup of pituitary disorders, or as an incidental finding when imaging the brain.
Encephalitis is a sudden onset inflammation of the brain.[1] Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.[2] In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths worldwide, down from 92,000 in 1990.[3] The word is from Ancient Greek ἐγκέφαλος, enképhalos "brain",[4] composed of ἐν, en, "in" and κεφαλή, kephalé, "head", and the medical suffix -itis "inflammation".[citation needed]
Encephalitis lethargica or von Economo disease is an atypical form of encephalitis. Also known as "sleepy sickness" (distinct from tsetse fly-transmitted sleeping sickness), it was first described in 1917 by the neurologist Constantin von Economo[1][2] and the pathologist Jean-René Cruchet.[3]
Encephalocele, sometimes known as cranium bifidum, is a neural tube defect characterized by sac-like protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull. These defects are caused by failure of the neural tube to close completely during fetal development. Encephaloceles cause a groove down the middle of the skull, or between the forehead and nose, or on the back side of the skull. The severity of encephalocele varies, depending on its location.[1]
Encephalomyelitis is a general term for inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, describing a number of disorders:
Encopresis (from the Ancient Greek ἐγκόπρησις / egkóprēsis), also known as paradoxical diarrhea, is voluntary or involuntary fecal soiling in children who have usually already been toilet trained. Children with encopresis often leak stool into their undergarments.
Endocardial Fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger.[1] It may also be considered a reaction to stress, not necessarily a specific disease.[2]
Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. It usually involves the heart valves. Other structures that may be involved include the interventricular septum, the chordae tendineae, the mural endocardium, or the surfaces of intracardiac devices. Endocarditis is characterized by lesions, known as vegetations, which is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inﬂammatory cells.[1] In the subacute form of infective endocarditis, the vegetation may also include a center of granulomatous tissue, which may fibrose or calcify.[2]
Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a malignant subtype of endometrial stromal tumor arising from the stroma (connective tissue) of the endometrium rather than the glands. There are three grades for endometrial stromal tumors, as follows.[1] It was previously known as endolymphatic stromal myosis because of diffuse infiltration of myometrial tissue or the invasion of lymphatic channels.[2]
Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus (endometrium) grows outside it.[1][2] Most often this is on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissue around the uterus and ovaries; however, in rare cases it may also occur in other parts of the body.[3] The main symptoms are pelvic pain and infertility. Nearly half of those affected have chronic pelvic pain, while in 70% pain occurs during menstruation. Pain during sex is also common. Infertility occurs in up to half of women affected.[4] Less common symptoms include urinary or bowel symptoms. About 25% of women have no symptoms.[4] Endometriosis can have both social and psychological effects.[5]
Enolase Deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of glucose metabolism. Partial deficiencies have been observed in several caucasian families. The deficiency is transmitted through an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.[1][2] The gene for Enolase 1 has been localized to Chromosome 1 in humans.[3] Enolase deficiency, like other glycolytic enzyme deficiences, usually manifests in red blood cells as they rely entirely on anaerobic glycolysis. Enolase deficiency is associated with a spherocytic phenotype and can result in hemolytic anemia, which is responsible for the clinical signs of Enolase deficiency.[4]
Entomophthoramycosis (or Entomophthoromycosis[1]:) is a mycosis caused by Entomophthorales.[2]
Enuresis (from the Ancient Greek ἐνούρησις enoúrēsis) is a repeated inability to control urination.[1] Use of the term is usually limited to describing individuals old enough to be expected to exercise such control.[2] Involuntary urination is also known as urinary incontinence.[3]
Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS) is an incurable and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition linked to the ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan.[1][2] The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age.[3] Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS.[4] The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain).[5][6][7]
Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall.[1] Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection.[1] Its cause is not entirely clear; however, may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.[2]
Eosinophilic fasciitis (/ˌiːəˌsɪnəˈfɪlɪk ˌfæʃiˈaɪtᵻs, ˌiːoʊ-, -ˌfæsi-/[1][2]), also known as "Shulman's syndrome",[3] is a form of fasciitis, the inflammatory diseases that affect the fascia, the connective tissues surrounding muscles, blood vessels and nerves. Unlike other diseases in that category, it is limited to the arms and legs, and usually resolves itself, although some cases require corticosteroids, and some cases are associated with aplastic anemia.[4]
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare and heterogeneous condition characterized by patchy or diffuse eosinophilic infiltration of gastrointestinal (GI) tissue, first described by Kaijser in 1937.[1][2] Presentation may vary depending on location as well as depth and extent of bowel wall involvement and usually runs a chronic relapsing course. It can be classified into mucosal, muscular and serosal types based on the depth of involvement.[3][4] Any part of the GI tract can be affected, and isolated biliary tract involvement has also been reported.[5][6] The stomach is the organ most commonly affected, followed by the small intestine and the colon.[7][8]
Eosinophilic granuloma is a form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is a condition of both human and veterinary pathology. Colloquially, the reaction pattern is sometimes referred to as a rodent ulcer.
Eosinophilic folliculitis (also known as "Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis" and "Sterile eosinophilic pustulosis"[1]) is an itchy rash with an unknown cause that is most common among individuals with HIV, though it can occur in HIV-negative individuals where it is known by the eponym Ofuji disease.[2] EF consists of itchy red bumps (papules) centered on hair follicles and typically found on the upper body, sparing the abdomen and legs. The name eosinophilic folliculitis refers to the predominant immune cells associated with the disease (eosinophils) and the involvement of the hair follicles.
Ependymoma is a tumor that arises from the ependyma, a tissue of the central nervous system. Usually, in pediatric cases the location is intracranial, while in adults it is spinal. The common location of intracranial ependymoma is the fourth ventricle. Rarely, ependymoma can occur in the pelvic cavity.
Epicondylitis is a type of musculoskeletal disorder that refers to an inflammation of an epicondyle.
Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV, also called Lewandowsky–Lutz dysplasia), colloquially known as tree man illness is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic[1] hereditary skin disorder associated with a high risk of carcinoma of the skin. It is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the skin.[2] The resulting uncontrolled HPV infections result in the growth of scaly macules and papules, particularly on the hands and feet. It is typically associated with HPV types 5 and 8,[3] which are found in about 80% of the normal population as asymptomatic infections,[4] although other types may also contribute.[3]
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a chronic subepidermal blistering disease associated with autoimmunity to type VII collagen[1] within anchoring fibril structures that are located at the dermoepidermal junction.[2]:609
Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited connective tissue diseases that cause blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, with an incidence of 20 per million newborns in the United States.[1] It is a result of a defect in anchoring between the epidermis and dermis, resulting in friction and skin fragility. Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.
Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, (also known as Bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma,[1] Bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma,[2]:482 or bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma Brocq[3]) is a rare ichthyosis skin disease affecting around 1 in 250,000 people.
Epididymitis is a medical condition characterized by discomfort or pain of the epididymis, a curved structure at the back of the testicle in which sperm matures and is stored. Epididymitis is usually characterized as either acute or chronic: if acute, the onset of testicular pain is often accompanied by inflammation, redness, and warmth in the scrotum; if chronic, pain may be the only symptom. In either form, testicular pain in one or both testes can vary from mild to severe, and one or both epididymides may noticeably swell (inflame) and/ or harden (indurate). The pain is often cyclical and may last from less than an hour to several days.[1]
Epilepsia partialis continua (also called Kojevnikov's or Kozhevnikov's epilepsia) is a rare[1] type of brain disorder in which a patient experiences recurrent motor epileptic seizures that are focal (hands and face), and recur every few seconds or minutes for extended periods (days or years).
Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures.[1][2] Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking.[3] These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones.[3] In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause.[1] Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy.[4] People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.[3]
Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a rare epilepsy syndrome caused by a variety of genetic disorders. The syndrome includes myoclonic seizures and tonic-clonic seizures together with progressive neurological decline.
Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, abbreviated EMCa, is a rare malignant tumour that typically arises in a salivary gland and consists of both an epithelial and myoepithelial component. They are predominantly found in the parotid gland[1] and represent approximately 1% of salivary gland tumours.[2]
Equinophobia or hippophobia is a psychological fear of horses. Equinophobia is derived from the Greek word φόβος (phóbos), meaning "fear" and the Latin word equus, meaning "horse". The term hippophobia is also derived from the Greek word phóbos with the prefix derived from the Greek word for horse, ἵππος (híppos).[1][2]
Erdheim–Chester disease (also known as Erdheim–Chester syndrome or polyostotic sclerosing histiocytosis) is a rare disease characterized by the abnormal multiplication of a specific type of white blood cells called histiocytes, or tissue macrophages (technically, this disease is termed a non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis). Usually, onset is in middle age. The disease involves an infiltration of lipid-laden macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes in the bone marrow, and a generalized sclerosis of the long bones.[1]
Ergophobia or ergasiophobia is an abnormal and persistent fear of work (manual labor, non-manual labour, etc.) or finding employment. Ergophobia may also be a subset of either social phobia or performance anxiety. Sufferers of ergophobia experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may actually be a combination of fears, such as fear of failing at assigned tasks, speaking before groups at work (both of which are types of performance anxiety), socializing with co-workers (a type of social phobia), and other fears of emotional, psychological and/or physiological injuries.[1]
Erysipelas (/ɛrᵻˈsɪpələs/; Greek ἐρυσίπελας, "red skin"; also known as "ignis sacer", "holy fire", and "St. Anthony's fire"[1] in some countries) is an acute infection[2] typically with a skin rash, usually on any of the legs and toes, face, arms, and fingers. It is an infection of the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics, usually caused by beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus bacteria on scratches or otherwise infected areas.[3] Erysipelas is more superficial than cellulitis, and is typically more raised and demarcated.[4]
Erythema multiforme (EM) is a skin condition of unknown cause; it is a type of erythema possibly mediated by deposition of immune complexes (mostly IgM-bound complexes) in the superficial microvasculature of the skin and oral mucous membrane that usually follows an infection or drug exposure. It is an uncommon disorder, with peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. The disorder has various forms or presentations, which its name reflects (multiforme, "multiform", from multi- + formis). Target lesions are a typical manifestation. Two types, one mild to moderate and one severe, are recognized (erythema multiforme minor and erythema multiforme major).
Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory condition characterised by inflammation of the fat cells under the skin, resulting in tender red nodules or lumps that are usually seen on both shins. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and typically resolves spontaneously within 30 days.[1] It is common in young people between 12–20 years of age.
Erythrokeratodermia with ataxia (also known as "Giroux–Barbeau syndrome"[1]) is a condition characterized by erythematous, hyperkeratotic plaques with fine, white, attached scales distributed almost symmetrically on the extremities.[1]
Erythromelalgia, formerly known as Mitchell's disease (after Silas Weir Mitchell), is a rare vascular peripheral pain disorder in which blood vessels, usually in the lower extremities or hands, are episodically blocked (frequently on and off daily), then become hyperemic and inflamed. There is severe burning pain (in the small fiber sensory nerves) and skin redness. The attacks are periodic and are commonly triggered by heat, pressure, mild activity, exertion, insomnia or stress. Erythromelalgia may occur either as a primary or secondary disorder (i.e. a disorder in and of itself or a symptom of another condition). Secondary erythromelalgia can result from small fiber peripheral neuropathy of any cause, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis,[1] hypercholesterolemia, mushroom or mercury poisoning, and some autoimmune disorders. Primary erythromelalgia is caused by mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit gene SCN9A.
Erythroplakia (or erythroplasia)[1]:734 is a clinical term to describe any erythematous (red) area on a mucous membrane,[2] that cannot be attributed to any other pathology.[3]:805
Erythroplasia of Queyrat is a squamous-cell carcinoma in situ of the glans penis (head of the penis) or inner prepuce (foreskin) in males,[1][2]:733[3]:656[4] and the vulvae in females.[5] It mainly occurs in uncircumcised males,[5][6] over the age of 40.[7] Erythroplasia of Queyrat may also occur on the anal mucosa or the oral mucosa.[7]
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a form of porphyria, which varies in severity and can be very painful. It arises from a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase, leading to abnormally high levels of protoporphyrin in the erythrocytes, plasma, skin and liver.[1] The severity varies significantly from individual to individual.

Esophageal atresia (or Oesophageal atresia) is a congenital medical condition (birth defect) that affects the alimentary tract. It causes the esophagus to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the stomach. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus. It is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the esophagus with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall.[clarification needed]
Esophageal varices (sometimes spelled oesophageal varices) are extremely dilated sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus.[1] They are most often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to cirrhosis; patients with esophageal varices have a strong tendency to develop bleeding. Esophageal varices are typically diagnosed through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.[2]
Esophoria is a condition characterised by inward deviation of the eye, usually due to extra-ocular muscle imbalance.
Esotropia is a form of strabismus in which one or both eyes turns inward. The condition can be constantly present, or occur intermittently, and can give the affected individual a "cross-eyed" appearance. It is the opposite of Exotropia. Esotropia is sometimes erroneously called “lazy eye,” which describes the condition of amblyopia—a reduction in vision of one or both eyes that is not the result of any pathology of the eye and cannot be resolved by the use of corrective lenses. Amblyopia can, however, arise as a result of esotropia occurring in childhood: In order to relieve symptoms of diplopia or double vision, the child's brain will ignore or “suppress” the image from the esotropic eye, which when allowed to continue untreated will lead to the development of amblyopia. Treatment options for esotropia include glasses to correct refractive errors (see accommodative esotropia below), the use of prisms and/or orthoptic exercises and/or eye muscle surgery. The term is from Greek eso meaning "inward" and trope meaning "a turning".[1]
Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them.[1]
Essential hypertension (also called primary hypertension or idiopathic hypertension) is the form of hypertension that by definition has no identifiable cause. It is the most common type of hypertension, affecting 95% of hypertensive patients,[1][2][3][4] it tends to be familial and is likely to be the consequence of an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Prevalence of essential hypertension increases with age, and individuals with relatively high blood pressure at younger ages are at increased risk for the subsequent development of hypertension. Hypertension can increase the risk of cerebral, cardiac, and renal events.[5]
Essential thrombocytosis (ET; also known as essential thrombocythemia, essential thrombocythaemia, primary thrombocytosis) is a rare chronic blood disorder characterised by the overproduction of platelets by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.[1] It may, albeit rarely, develop into acute myeloid leukaemia or myelofibrosis.[1] It is one of four myeloproliferative disorders (disorders characterised by increased production of a particular line of blood cell).[1]
Essential thrombocytosis (ET; also known as essential thrombocythemia, essential thrombocythaemia, primary thrombocytosis) is a rare chronic blood disorder characterised by the overproduction of platelets by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.[1] It may, albeit rarely, develop into acute myeloid leukaemia or myelofibrosis.[1] It is one of four myeloproliferative disorders (disorders characterised by increased production of a particular line of blood cell).[1]
Esthesioneuroblastoma, also called "olfactory neuroblastoma", is a rare cancer of the nasal cavity. Arising from the upper nasal tract, esthesioneuroblastoma is believed to originate from sensory neuroepithelial cells, also known as neuroectodermal olfactory cells.[1] Fewer than 700 cases have been documented in the United States alone.[2] Due to the location of the tumor and its proximity to the cranial cavity, esthesioneuroblastoma can be highly invasive and challenging to treat. There is no consensus on appropriate treatment approach of esthesioneuroblastoma because of the rarity of the disease. Most studies reported cranial surgical resection with radiotherapy or chemotherapy to target the tumor.[3]
Eumycetoma is a chronic granulomatous[1] fungal disease[2] of humans, affecting mainly the limbs, and sometimes the abdominal and chest walls or the head.[3] Mycetoma pedis (mycetoma of the foot), the most common form of mycetoma, is known widely as the Madura foot. The infection is endemic in Africa, India and the Central and South Americas.[4]
Ewing's sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma (/ˈjuːɪŋ/) is a malignant small, round, blue cell tumor. It is a rare disease in which cancer cells are found in the bone or in soft tissue. The most common areas in which it occurs are the pelvis, the femur, the humerus, the ribs and clavicle (collar bone).
Exencephaly, is a type of cephalic disorder wherein the brain is located outside of the skull. This condition is usually found in embryos as an early stage of anencephaly. As an exencephalic pregnancy progresses, the neural tissue gradually degenerates.
Exophoria is a form of heterophoria in which there is a tendency of the eyes to deviate outward.[1] During examination, when the eyes are dissociated, the visual axes will appear to diverge away from one another.[2]
Exophthalmos (also called exophthalmus, exophthalmia, proptosis, or exorbitism) is a bulging of the eye anteriorly out of the orbit. Exophthalmos can be either bilateral (as is often seen in Graves' disease) or unilateral (as is often seen in an orbital tumor). Complete or partial dislocation from the orbit is also possible from trauma or swelling of surrounding tissue resulting from trauma.
Exotropia is a form of strabismus where the eyes are deviated outward. It is the opposite of esotropia. People with exotropia often experience crossed diplopia. Intermittent exotropia is a fairly common condition. "Sensory exotropia" occurs in the presence of poor vision. Infantile exotropia (sometimes called "congenital exotropia") is seen during the first year of life, and is less common than "essential exotropia" which usually becomes apparent several years later.
Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is a benign condition in which a person hears loud imagined noises (such as a bomb exploding, a gunshot, or a cymbal crash) or experiences an explosive feeling when falling asleep or waking up.[1][2][3] These noises have a sudden onset, are typically brief in duration, and are often jarring for the sufferer.[4]
A facial cleft is an opening or gap in the face, or a malformation of a part of the face. Facial clefts is a collective term for all sorts of clefts. All structures like bone, soft tissue, skin etc. can be affected. Facial clefts are extremely rare congenital anomalies. There are many variations of a type of clefting and classifications are needed to describe and classify all types of clefting. Facial clefts hardly ever occur isolated; most of the time there is an overlap of adjacent facial clefts.[1]
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHMD, FSHD or FSH)—originally named Landouzy-Dejerine[2]—is a usually autosomal dominant inherited form of muscular dystrophy (MD)[3] that initially affects the skeletal muscles of the face (facio), scapula (scapulo) and upper arms (humeral). FSHD is the third most common genetic disease of skeletal muscle. Orpha.net lists the prevalence as 4/100,000[4] while a 2014 population-based study in the Netherlands reported a significantly higher prevalence of 12 in 100,000.[5]
Factor XIII deficiency occurs exceedingly rarely, causing a severe bleeding tendency. The incidence is one in a million to one in five million people, with higher incidence in areas with consanguineous marriage such as Iran that has the highest global incidence of the disorder.[1] Most are due to mutations in the A subunit gene (located on chromosome 6p25-p24). This mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome[1]) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are confined to the colon wall and removal can greatly reduce the spread of cancer.
Familial aortic dissection or FAD refers to the splitting of the wall of the aorta in either the arch, ascending or descending portions. FAD is thought to be passed down as an autosomal dominant disease and once inherited will result in dissection of the aorta, and dissecting aneurysm of the aorta, or rarely aortic or arterial dilation at a young age. Dissection refers to the actual tearing open of the aorta. However, the exact gene(s) involved has not yet been identified.[1] It can occur in the absence of clinical features of Marfan syndrome and of systemic hypertension.[2][3][4][5][6] Over time this weakness, along with systolic pressure, results in a tear in the aortic intima layer thus allowing blood to enter between the layers of tissue and cause further tearing. Eventually complete rupture of the aorta occurs and the pleural cavity fills with blood. Warning signs include chest pain, ischemia, and hemorrhaging in the chest cavity. This condition, unless found and treated early, usually results in death. Immediate surgery is the best prognosis in most cases.[7] FAD is not to be confused with PAU (penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers) and IMH (intramural hematoma), both of which present in ways similar to that of familial aortic dissection.[8]
Familial dysautonomia (FD), sometimes called Riley–Day syndrome[1] and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III (HSAN-III), is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system which affects the development and survival of sensory, sympathetic and some parasympathetic neurons in the autonomic and sensory nervous system resulting in variable symptoms, including insensitivity to pain, inability to produce tears, poor growth, and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises, pneumonia, problems with speech and movement, difficulty swallowing, inappropriate perception of heat, pain, and taste, as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility. FD does not affect intelligence. Originally reported by Conrad Milton Riley and Richard Lawrence Day in 1949,[2] FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN).[3] All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary inflammatory disorder.[1]:149 FMF is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in Mediterranean fever gene, which encodes a 781–amino acid protein called pyrin.[2] While all ethnic groups are susceptible to FMF, it "usually occurs in people of Mediterranean origin—including Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Arabs, Greeks, Turks and Italians".[3][4][5]
Fan death is a myth and misconception, well known in Korean culture, that running an electric fan in a closed room with unopened or no windows can lead to death. Despite no concrete evidence to support the concept, fan death persists due to its popularity as an urban myth or superstition.
Fanconi syndrome or Fanconi's syndrome (English /fɑːnˈkoʊni/, /fæn-/) is a syndrome of inadequate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules[1] of the kidney. The syndrome can be caused by various underlying congenital or acquired diseases, by toxicity (for example, from toxic heavy metals), or by adverse drug reactions.[2] It results in various small molecules of metabolism being passed into the urine instead of being reabsorbed from the tubular fluid (for example, glucose, amino acids, uric acid, phosphate, and bicarbonate). Fanconi syndrome affects the proximal tubules, namely, the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), which is the first part of the tubule to process fluid after it is filtered through the glomerulus, and the proximal straight tubule (pars recta), which leads to the descending limb of the loop of Henle.
Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease. Among those affected the majority develop cancer, most often acute myelogenous leukemia, and 90% develop bone marrow failure (the inability to produce blood cells) by age 40. About 60–75% of people have congenital defects, commonly short stature, abnormalities of the skin, arms, head, eyes, kidneys, and ears, and developmental disabilities. Around 75% of people have some form of endocrine problem, with varying degrees of severity.
Farmer's lung (not to be confused with silo-filler's disease) is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by the inhalation of biologic dusts coming from hay dust or mold spores or other agricultural products.[1] It results in a type III hypersensitivity inflammatory response and can progress to become a chronic condition which is considered potentially dangerous.[2] While inhaled allergens often provoke the creation of IgE antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream, these types of immune response are most often initiated by exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes (most commonly Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula), which generates IgG-type antibodies. Following a subsequent exposure, IgG antibodies combine with the inhaled allergen to form immune complexes in the walls of the alveoli in the lungs. This causes fluid, protein, and cells to accumulate in the alveolar wall which slows blood-gas interchange and compromises the function of the lung.[3]
Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain. It is almost always caused by a mutation to the protein PrPC, but can also develop spontaneously in patients with a non-inherited mutation variant called sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI). FFI has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia, which leads to hallucinations, delirium, confusional states like that of dementia, and eventually, death.[1] The average survival time for patients diagnosed with FFI after the onset of symptoms is 18 months.[1]
Fatty liver is a reversible condition wherein large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of steatosis (i.e., abnormal retention of lipids within a cell). Despite having multiple causes, fatty liver can be considered a single disease that occurs worldwide in those with excessive alcohol intake and the obese (with or without effects of insulin resistance). The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence fat metabolism.[1] When this process of fat metabolism is disrupted, the fat can accumulate in the liver in excessive amounts, thus resulting in a fatty liver.[2] It is difficult to distinguish alcoholic FLD from nonalcoholic FLD, and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages.
A febrile seizure, also known as a fever fit or febrile convulsion, is a seizure associated with a high body temperature but without any serious underlying health issue. They most commonly occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.[1] Most seizures are less than five minutes in duration and the child is completely back to normal within sixty minutes of the event.[1][2]
Fechtner syndrome is a variant of Alport syndrome characterized by leukocyte inclusions, macrothrombocytopenia,[1] thrombocytopenia, nephritis, and sensorineural hearing loss. [2] Some patients may also develop cataracts. [3]
Feingold syndrome (also called oculodigitoesophagoduodenal syndrome) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. It is named after Murray Feingold, an American physician who first described the syndrome in 1975. Until 2003, at least 79 patients have been reported worldwide.[1]
Felty's syndrome, also called Felty syndrome,[1] is characterized by the combination of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly and neutropenia. The condition is more common in those aged 50–70 years, and is more prevalent in females than males and more in Caucasians than those of African descent. It is a deforming but inactive disease and seropositive for RF.[2][3]
Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is a disorder characterized by a persistent or recurrent inability to attain sexual arousal or to maintain arousal until the completion of a sexual activity. The diagnosis can also refer to an inadequate lubrication-swelling response normally present during arousal and sexual activity. The condition should be distinguished from a general loss of interest in sexual activity and from other sexual dysfunctions, such as the orgasmic disorder (anorgasmia) and hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity for some period of time.
Femur-fibula-ulna syndrome (FFU syndrome) or femur-fibula-ulna complex is a very rare syndrome characterized by abnormalities of the femur (thigh bone), fibula (calf bone) and the ulna (forearm bone). There have been suggestions that FFU complex may be the same as proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD) although authors are currently in disagreement over whether or not the disorders are in fact separate. The breadth of the abnormality and number of limbs involved is considered sporadic although upper limbs are more affected than lower limbs and right side malformation is more prevalent than the left.[1] The condition was first noted by Lenz and Feldman in 1977.[2]
Fetal hydantoin syndrome, also called fetal dilantin syndrome is a group of defects caused to the developing fetus by exposure to the teratogenic effects of phenytoin or carbamazepine. Dilantin is the brand name of the drug phenytoin sodium in the United States, commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy.
Fetal warfarin syndrome (dysmorphism due to warfarin, warfarin embryopathy) is a condition associated with administration of warfarin during pregnancy.[1]
FG syndrome (FGS; also known as Opitz–Kaveggia syndrome) is a rare genetic syndrome caused by one or more recessive genes located on the X chromosome and causing physical anomalies and developmental delays. FG syndrome was named after the first letters of the surnames of the first patients noted with the disease.[1] First reported by Opitz and Kaveggia in 1974,[2] its major clinical features include intellectual disability, hyperactivity, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and a characteristic facial appearance including macrocephaly (an abnormally large head).[3]
Fibrochondrogenesis is a rare[1] autosomal recessive[2] form of osteochondrodysplasia,[3] causing abnormal fibrous development of cartilage and related tissues.[4]
Fibromas (or fibroid tumors or fibroids) are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme tissue. The term "fibroblastic" or "fibromatous" is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term fibroma is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.
The term fibromatosis refers to a group of benign soft tissue tumors[1] which have certain characteristics in common, including absence of cytologic and clinical malignant features, a histology consistent with proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, an infiltrative growth pattern, and aggressive clinical behavior with frequent local recurrence.
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that causes abnormal growth within the wall of an artery.[1] FMD has been found in nearly every arterial bed in the body. However, the most common arteries affected are the renal and carotid arteries.[1][2][3]
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure.[2] Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory.[3] Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature.[4] Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.[3]
Fibrosarcoma (fibroblastic sarcoma) is a malignant mesenchymal tumour derived from fibrous connective tissue and characterized by the presence of immature proliferating fibroblasts or undifferentiated anaplastic spindle cells in a storiform pattern. It is usually found in males aged 30 to 40 .[citation needed] It originates in fibrous tissues of the bone and invades long or flat bones such as femur, tibia, and mandible. It also involves periosteum and overlying muscle.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), historically known as idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, is a chronic and ultimately fatal disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function.[2][3] The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of lung tissue and is the cause of worsening dyspnea (shortness of breath). Fibrosis is usually associated with a poor prognosis.[2][3][4]
Fibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process.[1] This can be a reactive, benign, or pathological state. In response to injury, this is called scarring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a fibroma. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can obliterate the architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing.[2] Defined by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.[3]

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare connective tissue disease. The disease is caused by a mutation of the body's repair mechanism, which causes fibrous tissue (including muscle, tendon, and ligament) to be ossified spontaneously or when damaged. In many cases, injuries can cause joints to become permanently frozen in place. Surgical removal of the extra bone growths has been shown to cause the body to "repair" the affected area with even more bone.
Erythema infectiosum or fifth disease is one of several possible manifestations of infection by parvovirus B19.[1] The disease is also referred to as slapped cheek syndrome, slapcheek, slap face or slapped face.[2][3]
Filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by an infection with roundworms of the Filarioidea type.[1] These are spread by blood-feeding black flies and mosquitoes. This disease belongs to the group of diseases called helminthiases.
Fish-eye disease is a genetic disorder involving a deficiency in lecithin—cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) metabolism.[1] While LCAT metabolism in familial LCAT deficiency is fully inactive, patients with fish-eye disease only have a partial deficiency of LCAT.[1] Carlson and Philipson found that the disease was named so because the cornea of the eye was so opaque or cloudy with dots of cholesterol that it resembled a boiled fish.[2]
Fissured tongue (also known as "scrotal tongue," "lingua plicata," "Plicated tongue,"[1]:1038 and "furrowed tongue"[2]:800) is a benign condition characterized by deep grooves (fissures) in the dorsum of the tongue. Although these grooves may look unsettling, the condition is usually painless. Some individuals may complain of an associated burning sensation.[3]
Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) involving liver capsule inflammation[1] leading to the creation of adhesions. The condition is named after the two physicians, Thomas Fitz-Hugh, Jr and Arthur Hale Curtis who first reported this condition in 1934 and 1930 respectively.[2][3][4]
Fitzsimmons–Guilbert syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disease characterized by a slowly progressive spastic paraplegia, skeletal anomalies of the hands and feet with brachydactyly type E, cone-shaped epiphyses, abnormal metaphyseal–phalangeal pattern profile, sternal anomaly (pectus carinatum or excavatum), dysarthria, and mild intellectual deficit.[1]
Flynn–Aird syndrome is a rare, hereditary, neurological disease that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The syndrome involves defects in the nervous, auditory, skeletal, visual, and endocrine systems and encompasses numerous symptoms, bearing striking similarity to other known syndromes of neuroectodermal nature such as: Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome and Refsum syndrome.[1]
Focal dermal hypoplasia (also known as "Goltz syndrome") is a form of ectodermal dysplasia.[1] It is a multisystem disorder characterized primarily by skin manifestations to the atrophic and hypoplastic areas of skin which are present at birth. These defects manifest as yellow-pink bumps on the skin and pigmentation changes.[2] The disorder is also associated with shortness of stature and some evidence suggests that it can cause epilepsy.[3]
Focal dystonia is a neurological condition that affects a muscle or group of muscles in a specific part of the body, causing involuntary muscular contractions and abnormal postures. For example, in focal hand dystonia, the fingers either curl into the palm or extend outward without control. In musicians, the condition is referred to as musician's focal dystonia, or simply, musician's dystonia. In sports, it is commonly referred to as the yips.
Focal facial dermal dysplasia (FFDD) is a rare genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by congenital bilateral scar like facial lesions, with or without associated facial anomalies. It is characterized by hairless lesions with fingerprint like puckering of the skin, especially at the temples, due to alternating bands of dermal and epidermal atrophy.
Foix–Chavany–Marie syndrome, also known as bilateral anterior opercular syndrome, is a partial paralysis of the face, pharynx, and jaw caused by bilateral damage to a specific region of the brain, the operculum. It is named for those who, in 1926, first described the condition—Charles Foix, Jean Alfred Émile Chavany, and Julien Marie—in a paper published in the Revue Neurologique.[1] [2] As a characteristic, there is no paralysis of upper or lower limbs and those affected can still make involuntary movement like smiling, eating or blinking eyes.
Foix–Alajouanine syndrome is a disorder caused by an arteriovenous malformation of the spinal cord.[1] The patients present with symptoms indicating spinal cord involvement (paralysis of arms and legs, numbness and loss of sensation and sphincter dysfunction), and pathological examination reveals disseminated nerve cell death in the spinal cord and abnormally dilated and tortuous vessels situated on the surface of the spinal cord. Surgical treatment can be tried in some cases. If surgical intervention is contraindicated, corticosteroids may be used.
Follicular lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It is the most common of the indolent (slow-growing) non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and the second-most-common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas overall. It is defined as a lymphoma of follicle center B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at least a partially follicular pattern. It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD22, and usually CD20,[1] but almost always negative for CD5.[2]
Foreign accent syndrome is a rare medical condition in which patients develop speech patterns that are perceived as a foreign accent[1] that is different from their native accent, without having acquired it in the perceived accent's place of origin.
Fountain syndrome is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by mental retardation, deafness, skeletal abnormalities and a coarse face with full lips. The abnormal swelling of the cheeks and lips are due to the excessive accumulation of body fluids under the skin. The deafness is due to malformation of the cochlea structure within the inner ear.
Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene affecting the perineum. It commonly occurs in elderly men, but it can also occur in women and children. It is more likely to occur in diabetics, alcoholics, or those who are immune compromised.
Fox–Fordyce disease, or apocrine miliaria, is a chronic blockage of the sweat gland ducts with a secondary, non-bacterial inflammatory response to the secretions and cellular debris in the cysts.[1] Hidradenitis is very similar, but tends to have a secondary bacterial infection so that pus-draining sinuses are formed. It is a very devastating skin disease that does not have universally curative treatments. Many that have this disease avoid sweat-inducing activities and prefer swimming as their mode of exercise.
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder. Symptoms often include mild to moderate intellectual disability. Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles. About a third of people have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech. Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%. Males are usually more affected than females.[1]
Franceschetti–Klein syndrome (also known as "Mandibulofacial dysostosis")[1] is a syndrome that includes palpebral antimongoloid fissures, hypoplasia of the facial bones, macrostomia, vaulted palate, malformations of both the external and internal ear, buccal-auricular fistula, abnormal development of the neck with stretching of the cheeks, accessory facial fissures, and skeletal deformities.[2]:577
Fraser syndrome (also known as Meyer-Schwickerath's syndrome, Fraser-François syndrome, or Ullrich-Feichtiger syndrome) is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder.[1][2] Fraser syndrome is named for the geneticist George R. Fraser, who first described the syndrome in 1962.
Frasier syndrome is a urogenital anomaly associated with the WT1 (Wilms tumor 1 gene) gene.[1]
Freeman–Sheldon syndrome (FSS), also termed distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A), craniocarpotarsal dysplasia (or dystrophy), Cranio-carpo-tarsal syndrome, Windmill-Vane-Hand syndrome, or Whistling-face syndrome, was originally described by Freeman and Sheldon in 1938.[1][2]:577 Freeman–Sheldon syndrome is a rare form of multiple congenital contracture (MCC) syndromes (arthrogryposes) and is the most severe form of distal arthrogryposis (DA).[3][4][5]
Frey's syndrome (also known as Baillarger’s syndrome, Dupuy’s syndrome, auriculotemporal syndrome,[1] or Frey-Baillarger syndrome) is a rare neurological disorder resulting from damage to or near the parotid glands responsible for making saliva, and from damage to the auriculotemporal nerve often from surgery.[1][2]
Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It manifests in initial symptoms of poor coordination such as gait disturbance; it can also lead to scoliosis, heart disease and diabetes, but does not affect cognitive function. The disease is progressive, and ultimately a wheelchair is required for mobility. Its incidence in the general population is roughly 1 in 50,000.
Frontonasal dysplasia (FND) (also known as median cleft face syndrome, frontonasal dysostosis, frontonasal malformation or Tessier cleft number 0/14) is a congenital malformation of the midface.[1] For the diagnosis of FND, a patient should present at least two of the following characteristics: hypertelorism (an increased distance between the eyes), a wide nasal root, vertical midline cleft of the nose and/or upper lip, cleft of the wings of the nose, malformed nasal tip, encephalocele (an opening of the skull with protrusion of the brain) or V-shaped hair pattern on the forehead.[1] The cause of FND remains unknown. FND seems to be sporadic (random) and multiple environmental factors are suggested as possible causes for the syndrome. However, in some families multiple cases of FND were reported, which suggests a genetic cause of FND.[2][3]
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal and/or temporal lobes, and typical loss of over 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact.[1]
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. Individuals affected with HFI are asymptomatic until they ingest fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If fructose is ingested, the enzymatic block at aldolase B causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This accumulation has downstream effects on gluconeogenesis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Symptoms of HFI include vomiting, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia and potentially kidney failure. While HFI is not clinically a devastating condition, there are reported deaths in infants and children as a result of the metabolic consequences of HFI. Death in HFI is always associated with problems in diagnosis.[1]
Fucosidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder[1] in which the FUCA1 gene experiences mutations that severely reduce or stop the activity of the alpha-L-fucosidase enzyme.[2] The result is a buildup of complex sugars in parts of the body, which leads to death. Fucosidosis is one of nine identified glycoprotein storage diseases. The gene encoding the alpha-fucosidase, FUCA 1, was found to be located to the short arm of chromosome 1p36 - p34,[3] by Carrit and co-workers, in 1982.[4]
Dissociative fugue, formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder.[1] It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. The state is usually short-lived (ranging from hours to days), but can last months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
Fumarase deficiency (or fumaric aciduria), also known as "Polygamist Down's",[1] is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme fumarate hydratase, which is indicated by a buildup of fumaric acid in the urine.
Galactorrhea (also spelled galactorrhoea) (galacto- + -rrhea) or lactorrhea (lacto- + -rrhea) is the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast, unassociated with childbirth or nursing.
Galactokinase deficiency, also known as Galactosemia type 2 or GALK deficiency,[1] is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder marked by an accumulation of galactose and galactitol secondary to the decreased conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase.[2] The disorder is caused by mutations in the GALK1 gene, located on chromosome 17q24.[1] Galactokinase catalyzes the first step of galactose phosphorylation in the Leloir pathway of intermediate metabolism. Galactokinase deficiency is one of the three inborn errors of metabolism that lead to hypergalactosemia. The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Unlike classic galactosemia, which is caused by deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, galactokinase deficiency does not present with severe manifestations in early infancy. Its major clinical symptom is the development of cataracts during the first weeks or months of life, as a result of the accumulation, in the lens, of galactitol, a product of an alternative route of galactose utilization. The development of early cataracts in homozygous affected infants is fully preventable through early diagnosis and treatment with a galactose-restricted diet. Some studies have suggested that, depending on milk consumption later in life, heterozygous carriers of galactokinase deficiency may be prone to presenile cataracts at 20–50 years of age.[3]
Galactorrhea hyperprolactinemia is increased blood prolactin levels associated with galactorrhea (abnormal milk secretion). It may be caused by such things as certain medications, pituitary disorders and thyroid disorders. The condition can occur in males as well as females. Relatively common etiologies include prolactinoma, medication effect, kidney failure, granulomatous diseases of the pituitary gland, and disorders which interfere with the hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin release. Ectopic (non-pituitary) production of prolactin may also occur. Galactorrhea hyperprolactinemia is listed as a “rare disease” by the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. This means that it affects less than 200,000 people in the United States population.[1]
Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency, also called galactosemia type 1, classic galactosemia or GALT deficiency, is the most common type of galactosemia, an inborn error of galactose metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.[1] It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that can cause liver disease and death if untreated. Treatment of galactosemia is most successful if initiated early, and includes dietary restriction of lactose intake. Because early intervention is key, galactosemia is included in newborn screening programs in many areas. On initial screening, which often involves measuring the concentration of galactose in blood, classic galactosemia may be indistinguishable from other inborn errors of galactose metabolism, including galactokinase deficiency and galactose epimerase deficiency. Further analysis of metabolites and enzyme activities are needed to identify the specific metabolic error.
Galactosemia (British galactosaemia) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Galactosemia follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that confers a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for adequate galactose degradation.
Galloway Mowat syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive[1] genetic disorder, consisting of a variety of features including hiatal hernia, microcephaly and nephrotic syndrome.[2]
Ganglioglioma is a rare, slow-growing primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor which most frequently occurs in the temporal lobes of children and young adults.[1]
Gangliosidosis is a sub-category of Sphingolipidosis that contains two different types of lipid storage disorders caused by the accumulation of lipids known as gangliosides. There are two distinct genetic causes of the disease. Both are autosomal recessive and affect males and females equally.
Ganser syndrome is a rare dissociative disorder previously classified as a factitious disorder. It is characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly, other dissociative symptoms such as fugue, amnesia or conversion disorder, often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. It is also sometimes called nonsense syndrome, balderdash syndrome, syndrome of approximate answers, pseudodementia, hysterical pseudodementia or prison psychosis. This last name, prison psychosis, is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may represent an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials.
GAPO syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that causes severe growth retardation, and has been observed fewer than 30 times before 2011.[1] GAPO is an acronym that encompasses the predominant traits of the disorder: growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia (teeth failing to emerge from the gums), and worsening optic atrophy in some subjects. Other common symptoms include premature aging, large, prominent foreheads, and delayed bone aging. GAPO syndrome typically results in premature death around age 30-40, due to interstitial fibrosis and atherosclerosis.[2]
Gardner syndrome, also known as Gardner's syndrome or familial colorectal polyposis,[1] is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the colon together with tumors outside the colon.[2] The extracolonic tumors may include osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas,[3] as well as the occurrence of desmoid tumors in approximately 15% of affected individuals.
Dumping syndrome is a condition where ingested foods pass through the stomach very rapidly and enter the small intestine largely undigested. It happens when the small intestine expands too quickly due to the presence of hyperosmolar (having increased osmolarity) contents from the stomach. This causes symptoms due to the fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention.[1] "Early" dumping begins concurrently within 15 to 30 minutes from ingestion of a meal.[1] Symptoms of early dumping include nausea, vomiting, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue. "Late" dumping happens one to three hours after eating. Symptoms of late dumping include weakness, sweating, and dizziness. Many people have both types. The syndrome is most often associated with gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y) surgery.
Primary gastric lymphoma (lymphoma that originates in the stomach itself)[1] is an uncommon condition, accounting for less than 15% of gastric malignancies and about 2% of all lymphomas. However, the stomach is a very common extranodal site for lymphomas (lymphomas originating somewhere else with metastasis to stomach).[2] It is also the most common source of lymphomas in the gastrointestinal tract.[3]
Gastrocutaneous syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant cutaneous condition characterized by multiple lentigines.[1]
Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the stomach and small intestine.[1] Signs and symptoms include some combination of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.[2] Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur.[3][4] This typically lasts less than two weeks.[1] It is unrelated to influenza though it has been called the stomach flu.[5]
Gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder (GID) is the dysphoria (distress) a person experiences as a result of the sex and gender they were assigned at birth. In these cases, the assigned sex and gender do not match the person's gender identity, and the person is transgender. There is evidence suggesting that twins who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics or exposure to hormones before birth.[1]
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry, that is, apprehensive expectation about events or activities.[1] This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, as individuals with GAD typically anticipate disaster, and are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, death, family problems, friendship problems, interpersonal relationship problems, or work difficulties.[2][3] Individuals often exhibit a variety of physical symptoms, including fatigue, fidgeting, headaches, nausea, numbness in hands and feet, muscle tension, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, excessive stomach acid buildup, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bouts of breathing difficulty, difficulty concentrating, trembling, twitching, irritability, agitation, sweating, restlessness, insomnia, hot flashes, rashes, and inability to fully control the anxiety (ICD-10).[4] These symptoms must be consistent and ongoing, persisting at least six months, for a formal diagnosis of GAD.[1][2]
Koro is a culture-specific syndrome delusional disorder in which an individual has an overpowering belief that one's genitalia are retracting and will disappear, despite the lack of any true longstanding changes to the genitals.[1][2] Koro is also known as shrinking penis, and it is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The syndrome occurs worldwide, and mass hysteria of genital-shrinkage anxiety has a history in Africa, Asia, and Europe.[3] In the United States and Europe, the syndrome is commonly known as genital retraction syndrome.[4] The condition can be diagnosed through psychological assessment along with physical examination to rule out genuine disorders of the genitalia that could be causing true retraction.[5][6]
Genu varum (also called bow-leggedness, bandiness, bandy-leg, and tibia vara), is a physical deformity marked by (outward) bowing of the lower leg in relation to the thigh, giving the appearance of an archer's bow. Usually medial angulation of both femur and tibia is involved.
Genuphobia (from Latin word genu meaning "knee") is the fear of one's own knees or someone else's knees or the act of kneeling.[1][2][3]
Geographic tongue, also known by several other terms,[note 1] is an inflammatory condition of the mucous membrane of the tongue, usually on the dorsal surface. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 2–3% of the general population.[2][7] It is characterized by areas of smooth, red depapillation (loss of lingual papillae) which migrate over time. The name comes from the map-like appearance of the tongue,[8] with the patches resembling the islands of an archipelago.[2] The cause is unknown, but the condition is entirely benign (importantly, it does not represent oral cancer), and there is no curative treatment. Uncommonly, geographic tongue may cause a burning sensation on the tongue, for which various treatments have been described with little formal evidence of efficacy.
Gerodermia osteodysplastica (GO), also called geroderma osteodysplasticum and Walt Disney dwarfism,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive[2] connective tissue disorder included in the spectrum of cutis laxa syndromes.[2][3]
Gerstmann syndrome is a neuropsychological disorder that is characterized by a constellation of symptoms that suggests the presence of a lesion in a particular area of the brain. (It should not be confused with Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, which is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.) Destruction to the inferior parietal lobule of the dominant hemisphere results in Gerstmann's syndrome.
Gestational pemphigoid or pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a dermatosis of pregnancy,[1][2] being an autoimmune[3] blistering skin disease that occurs during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester, and/or immediately following pregnancy. It was originally called herpes gestationis because of the blistering appearance, although it is not associated with the herpes virus.
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a term used for a group of pregnancy-related tumours. These tumours are rare, and they appear when cells in the womb start to proliferate uncontrollably. The cells that form gestational trophoblastic tumours are called trophoblasts and come from tissue that grows to form the placenta during pregnancy.
Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare, autosomal recessive[1] neurological disorder that causes disorganization of neurofilaments. Neurofilaments form a structural framework that helps to define the shape and size of neurons and are essential for normal nerve function.
Giardiasis, popularly known as beaver fever,[3] is a parasitic disease caused by Giardia lamblia.[4] About 10% of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur they may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Vomiting, blood in the stool, and fever are less common.[1] Symptoms usually begin 1 to 3 weeks after exposure and without treatment may last up to six weeks.[2]
Gigantism, also known as giantism (from Greek γίγας gigas, "giant", plural γίγαντες gigantes), is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above average. In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone[1] in childhood resulting in people between 7 feet (2.13 m) and 9 feet (2.75 m) in height.
Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a common genetic liver disorder found in 3-12% of the population.[1][2][3][4][5]
Tourette syndrome (TS or simply Tourette's), is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood,[1] characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.
Gingivitis ("inflammation of the gum tissue") is a non-destructive disease that occurs around the teeth.[1] The most common form of gingivitis, and the most common form of periodontal disease overall, is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) that is attached to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced gingivitis.
Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive kidney disorder characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypocalciuria, and hypomagnesemia. It is caused by loss of function mutations of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (also known as NCC, NCCT, or TSC) located in the distal convoluted tubule.[1]
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss.[1] The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated.[1] Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly.[2] The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea.[1][2] Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.[1]
Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain.[1] Signs and symptoms of glioblastoma are initially non-specific. They may include headaches, personality changes, nausea, and symptoms similar to those of a stroke.[2] Worsening of symptoms is often rapid. This can progress to unconsciousness.[3]
A glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the brain or spine. It is called a glioma because it arises from glial cells. The most common site of gliomas is the brain.[1] Gliomas make up about 30% of all brain and central nervous system tumors and 80% of all malignant brain tumors.[2]
Gliomatosis cerebri (infiltrative diffuse astrocytosis) is a rare primary brain tumor. It is commonly characterized by diffuse infiltration of the brain with neoplastic glial cells that affect various areas of the cerebral lobes.[1] These malignancies consist of infiltrative threads that spread quickly and deeply into the surrounding brain tissue, or into multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, making them very difficult to remove with surgery or treat with radiation. [2] Gliomatosis cerebi behaves like a malignant tumor that is very similar to Glioblastoma.
Gliosarcoma is a rare type of glioma, a cancer of the brain that comes from glial, or supportive, brain cells, as opposed to the neural brain cells. Gliosarcoma is a malignant cancer, and is defined as a glioblastoma consisting of gliomatous and sarcomatous components.[1]
Glomerulonephritis (GN), also known as glomerular nephritis, is a term used to refer to several kidney diseases (usually affecting both kidneys). Many of the diseases are characterised by inflammation either of the glomeruli or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys, hence the name,[1] but not all diseases necessarily have an inflammatory component.
Glomerulosclerosis refers to a hardening of the glomerulus in the kidney. It is a general term to describe scarring of the kidneys' tiny blood vessels, the glomeruli, the functional units in the kidney that filter urine from the blood.
Glossophobia or speech anxiety is the fear of public speaking or of speaking in general.[1] The word glossophobia comes from the Greek γλῶσσα glōssa, meaning tongue, and φόβος phobos, fear or dread. Many people only have this fear, while others may also have social phobia or social anxiety disorder.
A glucagonoma is a rare tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas that results in the overproduction of the hormone glucagon. Alpha cell tumors are commonly associated with glucagonoma syndrome, though similar symptoms are present in cases of pseudoglucagonoma syndrome in the absence of a glucagon-secreting tumor.
Glucose-galactose malabsorption is a condition in which the cells lining the intestine cannot take in the sugars glucose and galactose, which prevents proper digestion of these molecules and larger molecules made from them.
Glutathione synthetase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder that prevents the production of glutathione. Glutathione helps prevent damage to cells by neutralizing harmful molecules generated during energy production. Glutathione also plays a role in processing medications and cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens), and building DNA, proteins, and other important cellular components.
Glycogen storage disease (GSD, also glycogenosis and dextrinosis) is the result of defects in the processing of glycogen synthesis or breakdown within muscles, liver, and other cell types.[1]
Glycosuria or glucosuria is the excretion of glucose into the urine. Ordinarily, urine contains no glucose because the kidneys are able to reabsorb all of the filtered glucose from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream. Glycosuria is nearly always caused by elevated blood glucose levels, most commonly due to untreated diabetes mellitus. Rarely, glycosuria is due to an intrinsic problem with glucose reabsorption within the kidneys (such as Fanconi syndrome), producing a condition termed renal glycosuria.[1] Glycosuria leads to excessive water loss into the urine with resultant dehydration, a process called osmotic diuresis.
GMS syndrome is a syndrome characterised by goniodysgenesis, intellectual disability, and short stature.[1]
A goitre (British English) or goiter (American English) (from the Latin gutteria) is a swelling of the neck or larynx resulting from enlargement of the thyroid gland (thyromegaly), associated with a thyroid gland that is not functioning properly.
Goldenhar syndrome (also known as Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral (OAV) syndrome) is a rare congenital defect characterized by incomplete development of the ear, nose, soft palate, lip, and mandible. It is associated with anomalous development of the first branchial arch and second branchial arch.[1] Common clinical manifestations include limbal dermoids, preauricular skin tags, and strabismus.[2]
Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez Syndrome (GLH) or cerebellotrigeminal-dermal dysplasia is a rare neurocutaneous(Phakomatosis) disorder affecting the trigeminal nerve and causing several other neural and physical abnormalities.[1] Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez Syndrome has been diagnosed in only 34 people.[2] Cases of Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez Syndrome may be under-reported as other diseases share the characteristics of cerebellar malformation shown in Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez Syndrome.[1][2] Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez Syndrome was first characterized in 1979.[3]
Gonadal dysgenesis is any congenital developmental disorder of the reproductive system[1] characterized by a progressive loss of germ cells on the developing gonads of an embryo.[2] This loss leads to extremely hypoplastic (underdeveloped) and dysfunctioning gonads mainly composed of fibrous tissue, hence the name streak gonads—i.e., a form of aplasia in which the ovary is replaced by functionless tissue. The accompanying hormonal failure also prevents the development of secondary sex characteristics in either sex, resulting in a sexually infantile female appearance and infertility.
Gorham's disease (pronounced GOR-amz), also known as Gorham vanishing bone disease and phantom bone disease,[2] is a very rare skeletal condition of unknown cause, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of distended, thin-walled vascular or lymphatic channels within bone, which leads to resorption and replacement of bone with angiomas and/or fibrosis.[3][4] Current treatments are experimental only.
Gougerot–Blum syndrome (also known as "Pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatitis,"[1] and "Pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatitis of Gougerot and Blum"[1]) is a variant of Pigmented purpuric dermatitis, a skin condition characterized by minute, rust-colored to violaceous, lichenoid papules that tend to fuse into plaques of various hues.[2]:829 Relative to other variants, it is characterized clinically by a male predominance, pruritus, with a predilection for the legs, and histologically, it features a densely cellular lichenoid infiltrate.[3]
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint.[3] Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours.[5] The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases.[6] It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.[5]
Granuloma annulare is a fairly rare, chronic dermatological condition which presents as reddish bumps on the skin arranged in a circle or ring.[1] It can initially occur at any age and is four times more common in females.
Graves' disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid.[1] It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.[2] It also often results in an enlarged thyroid.[1] Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy.[1] About 25% to 80% of people with the condition develop eye problems.[1][3]
Gray platelet syndrome (GPS), or platelet alpha-granule deficiency,[1] is a rare congenital autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by a reduction or absence of alpha-granules in blood platelets, and the release of proteins normally contained in these granules into the marrow, causing myelofibrosis.[2]
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition, caused by problems arising in the pituitary gland, in which the body does not produce enough growth hormone (GH). Growth hormone, also called somatropin, is a polypeptide hormone which stimulates growth and cell reproduction.
Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, also called GAMT deficiency, is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system and muscles. It is the first observed disorder of creatine metabolism.[2]
Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system.[2] The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks.[2] During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation.[1] Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.[2]
Gymnophobia is a fear (phobia) of nudity.
Gynecomastia is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which there is a non-cancerous increase in the size of male breast tissue.[3][4][a] Most adolescent boys, up to 70%,[6] have some breast development during puberty.[3] Newborn and adolescent males often experience temporary gynecomastia due to the influence of maternal hormones and hormonal changes during puberty, respectively.
Hagemoser–Weinstein–Bresnick syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder first described by Hagemoser et al. in 1989. It is characterized by optic atrophy followed shortly by loss of hearing and peripheral neuropathy. Onset of the disease occurred in early childhood, as opposed to the later onset of similar diseases. Optic atrophy occurs in the first year and the following symptoms show up before thirteen years.[1] A possible autosomal recessive form of this disease was described in 1970 by Iwashita et al.[2]
Hailey–Hailey disease, or familial benign chronic pemphigus[1]:559 or familial benign pemphigus,[2]:622 was originally described by the Hailey brothers (Hugh Edward and William Howard) in 1939.[3][4] It is a genetic disorder that causes blisters to form on the skin.
Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. It is usually classified as a sub-type of chronic lymphoid leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia makes up approximately 2% of all leukemias, with fewer than 2,000 new cases diagnosed annually in North America and Western Europe combined.
Hairy palms and soles are both a type of cutaneous condition characterized by a hereditary hypertrichosis affecting the palms and soles. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.[1]
Black hairy tongue (BHT, also termed lingua villosa nigra)[1][2] refers to a condition of the tongue where the filiform papillae elongate with black or brown discoloration, giving a black and hairy appearance. The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, xerostomia (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and certain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue.[3]
Hajdu–Cheney syndrome, also called acroosteolysis with osteoporosis and changes in skull and mandible, arthrodentoosteodysplasia, and Cheney syndrome,[1] is an extremely rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder[2][3] of the connective tissue characterized by severe and excessive bone resorption leading to osteoporosis and a wide range of other possible symptoms. Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene, identified in 2011, cause HCS. HCS is so rare that only about 70 cases have been reported worldwide, since the discovery of the syndrome in 1948.
Halal syndrome is a rare disorder characterised by microcephaly, cleft palate, and variable other anomalies.
Hallermann–Streiff syndrome (also known as oculomandibulofacial syndrome, François dyscephalic syndrome, Hallermann–Streiff–François syndrome, oculomandibulodyscephaly with hypotrichosis, Aubry syndrome, and Ullrich-Fremery-Dohna syndrome) is a congenital disorder that affects growth, cranial development, hair growth and dental development.
Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a disorder characterized by a continual presence of sensory disturbances, most commonly visual, that are reminiscent of those generated by the use of hallucinogenic substances. Previous use of hallucinogens by the person is necessary, but not sufficient, for diagnosis of HPPD. For an individual to be diagnosed with HPPD, the symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition. HPPD is distinct from flashbacks by reason of its relative permanence; while flashbacks are transient, HPPD is persistent. HPPD is a DSM-IV diagnosis with diagnostic code 292.89.
Hand–Schüller–Christian disease is associated with multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Hanhart syndrome is a congenital disorder that causes an undeveloped tongue and malformed extremities and fingers.
Harding ataxia, also known as Early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained reflexes (EOCARR), is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia originally described by Harding in 1981.[1] This form of cerebellar ataxia is similar to Friedreich ataxia including that it results in poor reflexes and balance, but differs in several ways, including the absence of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, skeletal abnormalities, and the fact that tendon reflexes in the arms and knees remain intact.[2] This form of ataxia is characterized by onset in the first 20 years, and is less severe than Friedreich ataxia. Additional cases were diagnosed in 1989,[3] 1990,[4] 1991,[5] and 1998.[6]
Harpaxophobia is the fear of being robbed.[1][2]
Hartnup disease (also known as "pellagra-like dermatosis"[1] and "Hartnup disorder"[2]) is an autosomal recessive[3] metabolic disorder affecting the absorption of nonpolar amino acids (particularly tryptophan that can be, in turn, converted into serotonin, melatonin, and niacin). Niacin is a precursor to nicotinamide, a necessary component of NAD+.[4]:541
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed.[1] Early on there may be no symptoms.[1] Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goitre.[1] Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains.[1] After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size.[1] Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma.[2]
Hay–Wells syndrome (also known as AEC syndrome; see Naming) is one of at least 150 known types of ectodermal dysplasia.[1][2]
Hearing loss, also known as hearing impairment, is a partial or total inability to hear.[2] A deaf person has little to no hearing.[3] Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears.[3] In children hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken language and in adults it can cause work related difficulties.[4] In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.[3] Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.
Heart block is a disease or inherited condition that causes a fault within the heart's natural pacemaker due to some kind of obstruction (or "block") in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Despite the severe-sounding name, heart block may often cause no symptoms at all in some cases, or occasional missed heartbeats in other cases (which can cause lightheadedness, syncope (fainting), and palpitations), or may require an artificial pacemaker to be implanted, depending upon exactly where in the heart conduction is being impaired and how significantly it is affected.
HEC syndrome is a syndrome characterized by hydrocephalus, endocardial fibroelastosis and cataracts.
Heliophobia is the fear of the sun, sunlight, or any bright light. It is a type of specific phobia.
HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening obstetric complication usually considered to be a variant or complication of pre-eclampsia.[1] Both conditions usually occur during the later stages of pregnancy, or sometimes after childbirth. "HELLP" is an abbreviation of the three main features of the syndrome:[2]
Helminthiasis (plural helminthiases), also known as worm infection, is any macroparasitic disease of humans and other animals in which a part of the body is infected with parasitic worms, known as helminths. There are numerous species of these parasites, which are broadly classified into tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms. They often live in the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts, but they may also burrow into other organs, where they induce physiological damage.
Hemangioblastomas (or haemangioblastomas, see spelling differences) (capilliary hemangioblastomas)[1][2] are tumors of the central nervous system that originate from the vascular system usually during middle-age. Sometimes these tumors occur in other sites such as the spinal cord and retina.[3] They may be associated with other diseases such as polycythemia (increased blood cell count), pancreatic cysts and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL syndrome). Hemangioblastomas are most commonly composed of stromal cells in small blood vessels and usually occur in the cerebellum, brain stem or spinal cord. They are classed as grade one tumors under the World Health Organization's classification system.[2]
Hemangioendothelioma is used to describe a group of vascular neoplasms that may be considered benign as well as malignant, depending on the specific group member's activity.
An infantile hemangioma (IH) is one of the most common benign tumors of infancy and occurs in approximately 5–10% of infants.[1][2][3] The word "hemangioma" comes from the Greek haema- (αίμα), "blood"; angeio (αγγείο), "vessel"; -oma (-ωμα), "tumor". Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors composed of an increased number of unique endothelial cells that line blood vessels.[4] They occur more frequently in female, premature and low birth weight infants.[5][6] Infantile hemangiomas usually appear within the first weeks of life and grow most rapidly during the first three to six months of life.[7][8][9][10] For most hemangiomas, 80% of infantile hemangioma size is generally reached by 3 months of age.[11] Usually, growth and proliferation is complete and involution commences by twelve months of age, however, involution occurs slowly over many years with a majority of infantile hemangioma regression occurring by five years of age.[12][13] Although infantile hemangiomas spontaneously regress over time, some may leave residual redundant fibrofatty tissue, scar, residual telangiectasia, or pigmentary changes.[1][14]
A hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that originates in the pericytes in the walls of capillaries. When inside the nervous system, although not strictly a meningioma tumor, it is a meningeal tumor with a special aggressive behavior. It was first characterized in 1942.[1]
Hematocolpos is a medical condition in which the vagina fills with menstrual blood. It is often caused by the combination of menstruation with an imperforate hymen.[1][2] It is sometimes seen in Robinow syndrome, uterus didelphys, or other congenital conditions.
Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face, most commonly the ears, the mouth and the mandible. It usually occurs on one side of the face, but both sides are sometimes affected. If severe, it may result in difficulties in breathing due to obstruction of the trachea — sometimes even requiring a tracheotomy. With an incidence in the range of 1:3500 to 1:4500, it is the second most common birth defect of the face, after cleft lip and cleft palate.[1] HFM shares many similarities with Treacher Collins syndrome.
Juvenile hemochromatosis (or hemochromatosis type 2) is, as its name indicates, a form of hemochromatosis which emerges during youth.
Haemochromatosis type 3 is a type of Iron overload disorder associated with deficiencies in transferrin receptor 2. It exhibits an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.[1][2][3]
Hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease, is a hereditary iron overload disorder that affects ferroportin, an iron transport protein needed to export iron from cells into circulation.[1] Although the disease is rare, it is found throughout the world and affects people from various ethnic groups. While the majority of individuals with type 4 hemochromatosis have a relatively mild form of the disease, some affected individuals have a more severe form. As the disease progresses, iron may accumulate in the tissues of affected individuals over time, potentially resulting in organ damage.[2]
Hemoglobinopathy is a kind of genetic defect that results in abnormal structure of one of the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule.[1] Hemoglobinopathies are inherited single-gene disorders; in most cases, they are inherited as autosomal co-dominant traits.[2] Common hemoglobinopathies include sickle-cell disease. It is estimated that 7% of world's population (420 million) are carriers, with 60% of total and 70% pathological being in Africa. Hemoglobinopathies are most common in populations from Africa, the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia.
In medicine, hemoglobinuria or haemoglobinuria is a condition in which the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is found in abnormally high concentrations in the urine. The condition is often associated with hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed, thereby increasing levels of free plasma hemoglobin. Excess hemoglobin is filtered by the kidneys, which excrete it into the urine, giving urine a purple color.
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (or haemolytic-uraemic syndrome), abbreviated HUS, is a disease characterized by hemolytic anemia (anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells), acute kidney failure (uremia), and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). It predominantly, but not exclusively, affects children. Most cases are preceded by an episode of infectious, sometimes bloody, diarrhea acquired as a foodborne illness or from a contaminated water supply caused by E. coli O157:H7, other non-o157:H7 E. coli serotypes, Shigella, and Campylobacter. A variety of viruses have also been implicated as a causative agent. It is now the most common cause of acquired acute renal failure in childhood. It is a medical emergency and carries a 5–10% mortality rate; of the remainder, the majority recover without major consequences, approximately 30% suffer residual renal injury. The primary target appears to be the vascular endothelial cell. This may explain the pathogenesis of HUS, in which a characteristic renal lesion is capillary microangiopathy.[1]
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (British spelling), and hemophagocytic or haemophagocytic syndrome,[1] is an uncommon hematologic disorder. It is a life-threatening disease of severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and macrophages, characterised by proliferation of morphologically benign lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines. It is classified as one of the cytokine storm syndromes.
Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are vascular structures in the anal canal.[3][4] In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control.[2] They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term "hemorrhoid" is often used to refer to the disease.[4] The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present.[5] Internal hemorrhoids are usually present with painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating.[6][5] External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus. If bleeding occurs it is usually darker.[5] Symptoms frequently get better after a few days.[6] A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.[5]
Hemosiderosis (AmE) or haemosiderosis (BrE) is a form of iron overload disorder resulting in the accumulation of hemosiderin.
A hemothorax (hemo- + thorax) (or haemothorax or haemorrhagic pleural effusion) is a type of pleural effusion in which blood accumulates in the pleural cavity. This excess fluid can interfere with normal breathing by limiting the expansion of the lungs.
Hennekam syndrome also known as Hennekam lymphangiectasia–lymphedema syndrome and intestinal lymphagiectasia–lymphedema–mental retardation syndrome[1] is an autosomal recessive disorder consisting of intestinal lymphangiectasia, facial anomalies, peripheral lymphedema, and mild to moderate levels of growth and intellectual disability.[1][2]
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP),[help 1] also known as IgA vasculitis,[1] anaphylactoid purpura,[2] purpura rheumatica,[2] and Schönlein–Henoch purpura,[2] is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is the occurrence of confusion, altered level of consciousness, and coma as a result of liver failure. In the advanced stages it is called hepatic coma or coma hepaticum. It may ultimately lead to death.[1]
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease or veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed. It is a complication of high-dose chemotherapy given before a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is marked by weight gain due to fluid retention, increased liver size, and raised levels of bilirubin in the blood.[1] The name sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is now preferred if VOD happens as a result of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.[1][2]
Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.[3] Some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.[1][2] Hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months.[5][1] Acute hepatitis can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or rarely result in acute liver failure.[6] Over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer.[3]
Hepatitis A (formerly known as infectious hepatitis) is an infectious disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV).[1] Many cases have few or no symptoms, especially in the young.[2] The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is between two and six weeks.[3] When symptoms occur, they typically last eight weeks and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.[2] Around 10–15% of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the six months after the initial infection.[2] Acute liver failure may rarely occur, with this being more common in the elderly.[2]
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain.[1] Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death.[1][2] It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin.[1] In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do.[3] Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop.[4] These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.[1]
Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver.[1] During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[2] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices.[1]
Hepatitis D (hepatitis delta) is a disease caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small spherical enveloped RNA virus. This is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. HDV is considered to be a subviral satellite because it can propagate only in the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).[1] Transmission of HDV can occur either via simultaneous infection with HBV (coinfection) or superimposed on chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B carrier state (superinfection).
Hepatitis E is a viral hepatitis (liver inflammation) caused by infection with a virus called hepatitis E virus.[1] It is one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. HEV is a positive-sense single-stranded non-enveloped RNA icosahedral virus, HEV has a fecal-oral transmission route.[2][3] Infection with this virus was first documented in 1955 during an outbreak in New Delhi, India.[4] A preventative vaccine (HEV 239) is approved for use in China.[5]
Hepatoblastoma is an uncommon malignant liver cancer occurring in infants and children and composed of tissue resembling fetal liver cells, mature liver cells, or bile duct cells. They usually present with an abdominal mass. The disease is most commonly diagnosed during a child's first three years of life.[1] Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are commonly elevated, but when AFP is not elevated at diagnosis the prognosis is poor.[2]
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also called malignant hepatoma, is the most common type of liver cancer.
Hepatorenal syndrome (often abbreviated HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited blood disorder that causes episodic attacks of swelling that may affect the face, extremities, genitals, gastrointestinal tract and upper airways.[1][2]:152 In this form of angioedema, swellings of the intestinal mucous membrane may lead to vomiting and painful, colic-like intestinal spasms that may mimic intestinal obstruction. Airway edema may be life-threatening. Episodes may be triggered by trauma, surgery, dental work, menstruation, some medications, viral illness and stress; however, this is not always readily determined.[3] This disorder affects approximately one in 10,000–50,000 people.
Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, classified as an acute hepatic porphyria.[1] HCP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although homozygous individuals have been identified. Unlike acute intermittent porphyria, individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in porphyria cutanea tarda in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes. Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases. The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000. The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine, due to its reduced penetrance.
Hereditary elliptocytosis, also known as ovalocytosis, is an inherited blood disorder in which an abnormally large number of the patient's erythrocytes (i.e. red blood cells) are elliptical rather than the typical biconcave disc shape. Such morphologically distinctive erythrocytes are sometimes referred to as elliptocytes or ovalocytes. It is one of many red-cell membrane defects. In its severe forms, this disorder predisposes to haemolytic anaemia. Although pathological in humans, elliptocytosis is normal in camelids.
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. Individuals affected with HFI are asymptomatic until they ingest fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If fructose is ingested, the enzymatic block at aldolase B causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This accumulation has downstream effects on gluconeogenesis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Symptoms of HFI include vomiting, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia and potentially kidney failure. While HFI is not clinically a devastating condition, there are reported deaths in infants and children as a result of the metabolic consequences of HFI. Death in HFI is always associated with problems in diagnosis.[1]
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.[1][2]
Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is an inflammation of the pancreas, attributed to genetic causes. It was first described in 1952 by Comfort and Steinberg[1] but it was not until 1996 that Whitcomb et al[2] isolated the first responsible mutation in the trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on the long arm of chromosome seven (7q35).
Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), also known as hereditary spastic paraparesis, familial spastic paraplegias, French settlement disease, or Strumpell-Lorrain disease, is a group of inherited diseases whose main feature is progressive stiffness and contraction (spasticity) in the lower limbs,[1] as a result of damage to or dysfunction of the nerves.[2][3]
Hereditary spherocytosis (also known as Minkowski–Chauffard syndrome) is an autosomal dominant abnormality of erythrocytes. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes relating to membrane proteins that allow for the erythrocytes to change shape. The abnormal erythrocytes are sphere-shaped (spherocytosis) rather than the normal biconcave disk shaped. Dysfunctional membrane proteins interfere with the cell's ability to be flexible to travel from the arteries to the smaller capillaries. This difference in shape also makes the red blood cells more prone to rupture.[1] Cells with these dysfunctional proteins are taken for degradation at the spleen. This shortage of erythrocytes results in hemolytic anemia.
Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive[1] disorder which results in oculocutaneous albinism (decreased pigmentation), bleeding problems due to a platelet abnormality (platelet storage pool defect), and storage of an abnormal fat-protein compound (lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin).
Herpangina, also called mouth blisters, is a painful mouth infection caused by coxsackieviruses. Usually, herpangina is produced by one particular strain of coxsackie virus A (and the term "herpangina virus" refers to coxsackievirus A)[1] but it can also be caused by coxsackievirus B or echoviruses.[2] Most cases of herpangina occur in the summer,[3] affecting mostly children. However, it occasionally occurs in adolescents and adults. It was first characterized in 1920.[4]
Herpetophobia [1] is a common specific phobia, which consists of fear or aversion to reptiles, commonly lizards and snakes, and similar vertebrates as amphibians. It is one of the most diffused [2] animal phobias, very similar and related to ophidiophobia. This condition causes a slight to severe emotional reaction, as for example anxiety, panic attack or most commonly nausea.[3]
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, is a chronic skin disease characterized by clusters of abscesses or subcutaneous boil-like "infections" (often free of actual bacteria) that most commonly affects the underarms, under the breasts, inner thighs, groin, and buttocks.[1][2] Outbreaks are painful and may persist for years with interspersed periods of inflammation, often culminating in sudden drainage of pus. This process often forms open wounds that do not heal and frequently leads to significant scarring.
In dogs, hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints. It is a genetic (polygenic) trait that is affected by environmental factors. It can be found in many animals and in humans, but is most commonly associated with dogs, and is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds.
Histidinemia, also referred to as histidinuria, is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme histidase. Histidase is needed for the metabolism of the amino acid histidine.[1] Although originally thought to be linked to multiple developmental disorders histidinemia is now accepted as a relatively benign disorder,[2] leading to a reduction in the prevalence of neonatal screening procedures.[3]
Histoplasmosis (also known as "Cave disease,"[1] "Darling's disease,"[1] "Ohio valley disease,"[1] "reticuloendotheliosis,"[1] "spelunker's lung" and "caver's disease") is a disease caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Symptoms of this infection vary greatly, but the disease affects primarily the lungs.[2] Occasionally, other organs are affected; this is called disseminated histoplasmosis, and it can be fatal if left untreated.
Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking emotions, usually beginning in early adulthood, including inappropriately seductive behavior and an excessive need for approval. Histrionic people are lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, and flirtatious. HPD affects four times as many women as men.[1] It has a prevalence of 2–3% in the general population and 10–15% in inpatient and outpatient mental health institutions.[2]
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[1][2] AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[3] Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to use the vitamin biotin effectively. This disorder is classified as a multiple carboxylase deficiency, a group of disorders characterized by impaired activity of certain enzymes that depend on biotin. Symptoms are very similar to biotinidase deficiency and treatment – large doses of biotin – is also the same.
Holoprosencephaly (HPE, once known as arhinencephaly) is a cephalic disorder in which the prosencephalon (the forebrain of the embryo) fails to develop into two hemispheres. Normally, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of human pregnancy. The condition also occurs in other species.
Holt–Oram syndrome (also called Heart and Hand Syndrome, atrio-digital syndrome, atriodigital dysplasia, cardiac-limb syndrome, heart-hand syndrome type 1, HOS, ventriculo-radial syndrome[1]) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects bones in the arms and hands (the upper limbs) and may also cause heart problems. The syndrome includes an absent radial bone in the arms, an atrial septal defect, and a first degree heart block.[2] Holt–Oram syndrome is considered to be a phenocopy of thalidomide, since both the genetic disorder and the teratogenic effects have similar presentations in individuals.[citation needed]
Classical homocystinuria, also known as cystathionine beta synthase deficiency or CBS deficiency,[1] is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid methionine, often involving cystathionine beta synthase. It is an inherited autosomal recessive trait, which means a child needs to inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected.
Horner's syndrome is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side as the lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), partial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhidrosis (decreased sweating), with or without enophthalmos (inset eyeball).
Horseshoe kidney, also known as ren arcuatus (in Latin), renal fusion or super kidney, is a congenital disorder affecting about 1 in 600 people, more common in men.[1]
Hot tub folliculitis (also known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis) is a common type of folliculitis, a condition which causes inflammation of hair follicles.[1]:272
Howel–Evans syndrome is an extremely rare condition involving thickening of the skin in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (hyperkeratosis). This familial disease is associated with a high lifetime risk of esophageal cancer. For this reason, it is sometimes known as tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC).[1]
Ehrlichiosis ewingii infection[1] is an infectious disease caused by an intracellular bacteria, Ehrlichia ewingii.[2] The infection is transmitted to humans by the tick, Amblyomma americanum. This tick can also transmit Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the bacteria that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME).
Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficient (or absent) enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S).[1][2] The accumulated substrates in Hunter syndrome are heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate.[3] The syndrome has X-linked recessive inheritance.[3]
Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is an inherited disorder that results in death of brain cells.[1] The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities.[2] A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow.[3] As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent.[2] Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk.[2][3] Mental abilities generally decline into dementia.[4] The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people.[2] Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age.[1][4] The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation.[2] About 8% of cases start before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease.[4] People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.[2]
Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), Hurler's disease, also gargoylism, is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (formerly known as mucopolysaccharides) due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes.[1]:544 Without this enzyme, a buildup of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate occurs in the body. Symptoms appear during childhood and early death can occur due to organ damage.
Hydranencephaly or hydrancephaly [1] is a condition in which the brain's cerebral hemispheres are absent to varying degrees and the remaining cranial cavity is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.[2]
Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain.[1] This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies there may be a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes.[1]
Hydrolethalus syndrome (less commonly referred to as Salonen-Herva-Norio syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder that causes improper fetal development, resulting in birth defects and often stillbirth.[1]
Hydronephrosis—literally "water inside the kidney"—refers to distension and dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, usually caused by obstruction of the free flow of urine from the kidney. Untreated, it leads to progressive atrophy of the kidney.[1] One or both kidneys may be affected.[2] In cases of hydroureteronephrosis, there is distention of both the ureter and the renal pelvis and calices.[3]
Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals.[1] Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1] Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system.[2]
Hydrops fetalis is a condition in the fetus characterized by an accumulation of fluid, or edema, in at least two fetal compartments.[1] By comparison, hydrops allantois or hydrops amnion is an accumulation of excessive fluid in the allantoic or amniotic space, respectively.[2]
Hymenolepiasis is infestation by one of two species of tapeworm: Hymenolepis nana or H. diminuta. Alternative names are dwarf tapeworm infection and rat tapeworm infection. The disease is a type of helminthiasis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease.
Hyper IgM syndromes is a group of primary immune deficiency disorders characterized by defective CD40 signaling; via B cells affecting class switch recombination(CSR) and somatic hypermutation. Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination deficiencies are characterized by elevated serum Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels and a considerable deficiency in Immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA) and E (IgE). As a consequence, people with HIGM have decreased concentrations of serum IgG and IgA and normal or elevated IgM, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.[1][2][3]
Hyperaldosteronism, also aldosteronism,[1] is a medical condition wherein too much aldosterone is produced by the adrenal glands, which can lead to lowered levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) and increased hydrogen ion excretion (alkalosis). Most common cause of mineralocorticoid excess is primary hyperaldosteronism reflecting excess production of aldosterone by adrenal zona glomerulosa. Bilateral micronodular hyperplasia is more common than unilateral adrenal adenoma.
Hyperammonemia (or hyperammonaemia) is a metabolic disturbance characterised by an excess of ammonia in the blood. It is a dangerous condition that may lead to encephalopathy and death. It may be primary or secondary.
Hyperandrogenism, also known as androgen excess, is a medical condition characterized by excessive levels of androgens (male sex hormones such as testosterone) in the female body and the associated effects of the elevated androgen levels. It is an endocrinological disorder similar to hyperestrogenism. The most common conditions associated with hyperandrogenism are polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS, a set of symptoms caused by androgen excess in females, and various cancers that can cause androgen excess. In females, the condition usually present are some combination of acne, seborrhea (inflamed skin), hair loss on the scalp, increased body and/or facial hair (hirsutism), and an elevated sex drive or libido. The symptoms of hyperandrogenism are usually most effectively treated with antiandrogens. There is some controversy over whether hyperandrogenism provides an unfair advantage in athletics.
Hypercementosis is an idiopathic, non-neoplastic condition characterized by the excessive buildup of normal cementum (calcified tissue) on the roots of one or more teeth.[1] A thicker layer of cementum can give the tooth an enlarged appearance, which mainly occurs at the apex or apices of the tooth.
Hypercholesterolemia, also called dyslipidemia, is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood.[1] It is a form of high blood lipids and "hyperlipoproteinemia" (elevated levels of lipoproteins in the blood).[1]
Hyperekplexia ("exaggerated surprise") is a neurologic disorder classically characterised by pronounced startle responses to tactile or acoustic stimuli and hypertonia. The hypertonia may be predominantly truncal, attenuated during sleep and less prominent after a year of age. Classic hyperekplexia is caused by genetic mutations in a number of different genes, all of which play an important role in glycine neurotransmission. Glycine is used by the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Hyperekplexia is generally classified as a genetic disease,[1] but some disorders can mimic the exaggerated startle of hyperekplexia.[2]
The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a disease characterized by a persistently elevated eosinophil count (≥ 1500 eosinophils/mm³) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the heart, nervous system, or bone marrow.[1]
Hypergeusia is a taste disorder where the sense is abnormally heightened.[1][2] It can be associated with a lesion of the posterior fossa and Addison's Disease; where a patient will crave for salty and sour taste due to the abnormal loss of ions with urine.[3]
Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia) is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. This is generally a blood sugar level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 15–20 mmol/l (~250–300 mg/dl). A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7 mmol/l (100–126 mg/dl) (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered hyperglycemic, while above 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) is generally held to have diabetes. Chronic levels exceeding 7 mmol/l (125 mg/dl) can produce organ damage.[1]
Hyperglycerolemia, also known as Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD), is a genetic disorder where the enzyme glycerol kinase is deficient resulting in a build-up of glycerol in the body. Glycerol kinase is responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and glycerophospholipids in the body. Excess amounts of glycerol can be found in the blood and/ or urine. Hyperglycerolmia occurs more frequently in males. Hyperglycerolemia is listed as a “rare disease” by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which means it affects less than 200,000 people in the US population (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services).
Hyperglycinemia refers to a metabolic condition where glycine is elevated in the blood.
Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by abnormally increased sweating,[3] in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature.[4] Although primarily a physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate quality of life from a psychological, emotional, and social perspective.[5] It has been called by some 'the silent handicap'.[6]
Hyperhomocysteinemia or hyperhomocysteinaemia is a medical condition characterized by an abnormally high level of homocysteine in the blood, conventionally described as above 15 µmol/L.[1]
Hyperkalemia, also spelled hyperkalaemia, is an elevated level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum.[1] Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels above 5.5 mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia.[2][3] Typically this results in no symptoms.[1] Occasionally when severe it results in palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness.[1][4] An abnormal heart rate can occur which can result in cardiac arrest and death.[1][2]
Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP, HyperKPP) is a genetic disorder. It occurs in humans, horses (where it is also known as Impressive syndrome, after an index case in a horse named Impressive, or possibly one of his ancestors), and perhaps other animals. It is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder that affects sodium channels in muscle cells and the ability to regulate potassium levels in the blood. It is most commonly associated with horses, but occurs in humans, where it may be called Gamstorp episodic adynamy. It is characterized by muscle hyperexcitability or weakness which, exacerbated by potassium, heat or cold, can lead to uncontrolled shaking followed by paralysis. Onset in humans usually occurs in early childhood, but still occurs with adults.
Hyperlysinemia is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder characterized by an abnormal increase of lysine in the blood, but appears to be benign.[2] It is caused by mutations in AASS, which encodes α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase.[1][3]
Hyperostosis frontalis interna is a common, benign thickening of the inner side of the frontal bone of the skull. It is found predominantly in women after menopause and is usually asymptomatic. Mostly frequently it is found as an incidental finding discovered during an X-ray or CT scan of the skull.
Hyperoxaluria is an excessive urinary excretion of oxalate. Individuals with hyperoxaluria often have calcium oxalate kidney stones. It is sometimes called Bird's disease, after Golding Bird, who first described the condition.
Hyperparathyroidism is an increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood.[1] This occurs either from the parathyroid glands inappropriately making too much PTH (primary hyperparathyroidism) or other events triggering increased production by the parathyroid glands (secondary hyperparathyroidism).[2] Most people with primary disease have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.[3] In those with symptoms the most common is kidney stones with other potential symptoms including weakness, depression, bone pains, confusion, and increased urination.[2][4] Both types increase the risk of weak bones.[4][3]
Hyperphenylalaninemia is a medical condition characterized by mildly or strongly elevated concentrations of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylketonuria (PKU) can result in severe hyperphenylalaninemia.[1] Phenylalanine concentrations ([phe]) are routinely screened in newborns by the neonatal heel prick (Guthrie test), which takes a few drops of blood from the heel of the infant. Standard [phe] concentrations in unaffected persons are about 60µM: [phe] concentrations in persons with untreated phenylketonuria may be many times that (600µM to 2400µM), which indicate that the child is at risk for severe intellectual disability. Phenylketonuria is classed as an autosomal recessive condition: in heterozygous form, [phe] shows a moderate elevation, perhaps two-fold over that of unaffected homozygotes, which is classified as hyperphenylalaninemia (hyper- + phenylalanine + -emia = high [phe] in blood).
Hyperprolinemia, also referred to as prolinemia or prolinuria, is a condition which occurs when the amino acid proline is not broken down properly by the enzymes proline oxidase or pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, causing a buildup of proline in the body.
Hyperreflexia (or hyper-reflexia) is defined as overactive or overresponsive reflexes. Examples of this can include twitching or spastic tendencies, which are indicative of upper motor neuron disease as well as the lessening or loss of control ordinarily exerted by higher brain centers of lower neural pathways (disinhibition). See Autonomic dysreflexia.
Hypersensitivity (also called hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance) is a set of undesirable reactions produced by the normal immune system, including allergies and autoimmunity. They are usually referred to as an over- reaction of the immune system and these reactions may be damaging, uncomfortable, or occasionally fatal. Hypersensitivity reactions require a pre-sensitized (immune) state of the host. They are classified in four groups after the proposal of P. G. H. Gell and Robin Coombs in 1963.[1]
Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.[1] High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.[2] Long term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.[3][4]
Hypertensive retinopathy is damage to the retina and retinal circulation due to high blood pressure (i.e. hypertension).
Hyperthermia is elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation that occurs when a body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. Extreme temperature elevation then becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death.
Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland.[1] Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.[1] Some, however, use the terms interchangeably.[2] Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less in the old and during pregnancy.[3] An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death.[4] The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.[5]
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which a portion of the myocardium (heart muscle) is hypertrophic (enlarged) without any obvious cause, creating functional impairment of the heart.[2][3][4] It is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.[5] The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in any age group and a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.[6] In most patients, HCM is associated with little or no disability and normal life expectancy.[2]
Hypertropia is a condition of misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), whereby the visual axis of one eye is higher than the fellow fixating eye. Hypotropia is the similar condition, focus being on the eye with the visual axis lower than the fellow fixating eye. Dissociated Vertical Deviation is a special type of hypertropia leading to slow upward drift of one or rarely both eyes, usually when the patient is inattentive.
Hypertryptophanemia, also called familial hypertryptophanemia,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive[2] metabolic disorder that results in a massive buildup of the amino acid tryptophan in the blood, with associated symptoms and tryptophanuria (-uria denotes "in the urine").[3][4]
Hypervitaminosis A refers to the toxic effects of ingesting too much preformed vitamin A. Symptoms arise as a result of altered bone metabolism and altered metabolism of other fat-soluble vitamins. Hypervitaminosis A is believed to have occurred in early humans, and the problem has persisted throughout human history.
Hypervitaminosis D is a state of vitamin D toxicity. The normal range for blood concentration is 30.0 to 74.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).[1]
Hypervitaminosis E is a state of vitamin E toxicity. Since vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant and may increase the risk of bleeding problems, many agencies have set a tolerable upper intake levels (UL) for vitamin E at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) per day.[1] This UL was established due to an increased incidence of hemorrhaging with higher doses of supplemental vitamin E. Doses of vitamin E above the UL can also magnify the antiplatelet effects of certain drugs such as anti-coagulant medications and aspirin, which can cause life-threatening symptoms in ill patients. Hypervitaminosis E may also counteract vitamin K, leading to a vitamin K deficiency.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or inhibited sexual desire (ISD) is considered a sexual dysfunction and is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity, as judged by a clinician. For this to be regarded as a disorder, it must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulties and not be better accounted for by another mental disorder, a drug (legal or illegal), or some other medical condition. A person with ISD will not start, or respond to their partner's desire for, sexual activity.[1] Other terms used to describe the phenomenon include sexual aversion and sexual apathy.[1]
In medicine (endocrinology), hypoaldosteronism refers to decreased levels of the hormone aldosterone.
Hypochondriasis, also known as hypochondria, health anxiety or illness anxiety disorder, refers to worry about having a serious illness. This debilitating condition is the result of an inaccurate perception of the condition of body or mind despite the absence of an actual medical condition.[1] An individual suffering from hypochondriasis is known as a hypochondriac. Hypochondriacs become unduly alarmed about any physical or psychological symptoms they detect, no matter how minor the symptom may be, and are convinced that they have, or are about to be diagnosed with, a serious illness.[2]
Hypochondrogenesis is a severe genetic disorder causing malformations of bone growth. The condition is characterized by a short body and limbs and abnormal bone formation in the spine and pelvis.
Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a developmental disorder caused by an autosomal dominant genetic defect in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) that results in a disproportionately short stature, micromelia,[1] and a head that appears large in comparison with the underdeveloped portions of the body, it is classified as short-limbed dwarfism.[2][3]
Hypodermyasis is a parasitic infection by the larvae of warble flies, most notably Hypoderma lineatum and Hypoderma bovis. These flies mostly infect cattle in the warmer areas of the northern hemisphere. Humans become hosts when they inadvertently swallow the eggs of those flies.[1]
Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels. This may result in a variety of symptoms including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness, and weakness may also be present. Symptoms typically come on quickly.[1]
Hypogonadism means diminished functional activity of the gonads—the testes in males or the ovaries in females—that may result in diminished sex hormone biosynthesis. In layman's terms, it is sometimes called interrupted stage 1 puberty. Low androgen (e.g., testosterone) levels are referred to as hypoandrogenism and low estrogen (e.g., estradiol) as hypoestrogenism, and may occur as symptoms of hypogonadism in both sexes, but are generally only diagnosed in males and females respectively. Other hormones produced by the gonads that hypogonadism can decrease include progesterone, DHEA, anti-Müllerian hormone, activin, and inhibin. Spermatogenesis in males, and ovulation in females, may be impaired by hypogonadism, which, depending on the degree of severity, may result in partial or complete infertility.
Hypokalemia, also spelled hypokalaemia, is a low level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum.[1] Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels below 3.5 mmol/L defined as hypokalemia.[1][2] Mildly low levels do not typically cause symptoms.[3] Symptoms may include feeling tired, leg cramps, weakness, and constipation.[1] It increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm such as bradycardia and cardiac arrest.[1][3]
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP) is a rare, autosomal dominant channelopathy characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis with a matching fall in potassium levels in the blood (primarily due to defect in a voltage-gated calcium channel). In individuals with this mutation, attacks often begin in adolescence and most commonly occur on awakening or after sleep or rest following strenuous exercise (attacks during exercise are rare), high carbohydrate meals, meals with high sodium content, sudden changes in temperature, and even excitement, noise, flashing lights and induced by cold temperatures. Weakness may be mild and limited to certain muscle groups, or more severe full-body paralysis. Attacks may last for a few hours or persist for several days. Recovery is usually sudden when it occurs, due to release of potassium from swollen muscles as they recover. Some patients may fall into an abortive attack or develop chronic muscle weakness later in life. To differentiate it from Guillain–Barré syndrome, deep tendon reflexes are normal and 7th cranial nerve is spared.[citation needed] During an attack reflexes may be decreased or absent.
Hypolipoproteinemia, hypolipidemia, or hypolipidaemia (British English) is a form of dyslipidemia that is defined by abnormally lowered levels of any or all lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood. It occurs through genetic disease (namely, Hypoalphalipoproteinemia and Hypobetalipoproteinemia), malnutrition, malabsorption, wasting disease, cancer, hyperthyroidism, and liver disease.
Hypoparathyroidism is decreased function of the parathyroid glands with underproduction of parathyroid hormone. This can lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, often causing cramping and twitching of muscles or tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), and several other symptoms. The condition can be inherited, but it is also encountered after thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery, and it can be caused by immune system-related damage as well as a number of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made with blood tests, and other investigations such as genetic testing depending on the results. The treatment of hypoparathyroidism is limited by the fact that there is no artificial form of the hormone that can be administered as replacement; calcium replacement or vitamin D can ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease.[1]
Hypophosphatasia (also called deficiency of alkaline phosphatase or phosphoethanolaminuria[1]) is a rare, and sometimes fatal, metabolic bone disease.[2] Clinical symptoms are heterogeneous, ranging from the rapidly fatal, perinatal variant, with profound skeletal hypomineralization and respiratory compromise, to a milder, progressive osteomalacia later in life. Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) deficiency in osteoblasts and chondrocytes impairs bone mineralization, leading to rickets or osteomalacia. The pathognomonic finding is subnormal serum activity of the TNSALP enzyme, which is caused by one of 200 genetic mutations identified to date, in the gene encoding TNSALP. Genetic inheritance is autosomal recessive for the perinatal and infantile forms but either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant in the milder forms. The prevalence of hypophosphatasia is not known; one study estimated the live birth incidence of severe forms to be 1:100,000.[3]
Hypopituitarism is the decreased (hypo) secretion of one or more of the eight hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.[1][2] If there is decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones, the term panhypopituitarism (pan meaning "all") is used.[3]
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left heart is severely underdeveloped. The International Working Group for Mapping and Coding of Nomenclatures for Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease defined HLHS as[1]
Hypoprothrombinemia is a blood disorder in which a deficiency of prothrombin (Factor II) results in impaired blood clotting, leading to an increased physiological risk for bleeding, especially in the gastrointestinal system, cranial vault, and superficial integumentary system.
Hypothermia is reduced body temperature that happens when a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. In humans, it is defined as a body core temperature below 35.0 °C (95.0 °F). Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes his or her clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping.[2]
Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.[3] It can cause a number of symptoms, such as amazing ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain.[3] Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre.[3] Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.[4]
Hypotrichosis (hypo- + tricho- + -osis) is a condition of abnormal hair patterns - predominantly loss or reduction. It occurs, most frequently, by the growth of vellus hair in areas of the body that normally produce terminal hair. Typically, the individual's hair growth is normal after birth, but shortly thereafter the hair is shed and replaced with sparse, abnormal hair growth. The new hair is typically fine, short and brittle, and may lack pigmentation. Baldness may be present by the time the subject is 25 years old.[1]
Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level. Hypoxia may be classified as either generalized, affecting the whole body, or local, affecting a region of the body. Although hypoxia is often a pathological condition, variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology, for example, during hypoventilation training[1] or strenuous physical exercise.
Ichthyoallyeinotoxism, or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, comes from eating certain species of fish found in several parts of the tropics, the effects of which are reputed to be similar in some aspects to LSD. Experiences may include vivid auditory and visual hallucinations. This has given rise to the collective common name "dream fish" for ichthyoallyeinotoxic fish.
Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is a type of familial, autosomal dominant ichthyosis, a rare skin disorder.[1]:491 It is also known as bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma of Siemens or ichthyosis exfoliativa. It is a genetic disorder with no known cure which is estimated to affect about 1 in 500,000 people.[2]
Ichthyosis linearis circumflexa is a distinctive skin condition of generalized hyperkeratosis and polycyclic and serpiginous erythematous plaques with a characteristic, migratory, double-edged scale at the margins, and is the typical cutaneous manifestation of Netherton's syndrome.[1]:496[2]:563
Ichthyosis vulgaris (also known as "Autosomal dominant ichthyosis,"[1] and "Ichthyosis simplex"[1]) is a skin disorder causing dry, scaly skin. It is the most common form of ichthyosis,[2]:486 affecting around 1 in 250 people.[3] For this reason it is known as common ichthyosis. It is usually an autosomal dominant inherited disease (often associated with filaggrin), although a rare non-heritable version called acquired ichthyosis exists.[4]:560
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), historically known as idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, is a chronic and ultimately fatal disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function.[2][3] The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of lung tissue and is the cause of worsening dyspnea (shortness of breath). Fibrosis is usually associated with a poor prognosis.[2][3][4]
Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (or idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis; IPH) is a lung disease of unknown cause that is characterized by alveolar capillary bleeding and accumulation of haemosiderin in the lungs. It is rare, with an incidence between 0.24[1] and 1.23[2] cases per million people.
Idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis (ISM) or mesenteric panniculitus is a rare disease of the small intestine, characterized by chronic inflammation and eventual fibrosis of the mesentery.[1] It has also been called mesenteric lipodystrophy, or retractile mesenteritis.[2]
IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, various degrees of fibrosis (scarring) and a prompt response usually to oral steroids.
Iminoglycinuria, sometimes called familial iminoglycinuria,[1][2][3] is an autosomal recessive[4] disorder of renal tubular transport affecting reabsorption of the amino acid glycine, and the imino acids proline and hydroxyproline.[4][5] This results in excess urinary excretion of all three acids (-uria denotes "in the urine").[6]
An imperforate anus or anorectal malformations (ARMs) are birth defects in which the rectum is malformed. ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies in males and females, that varies from fairly minor lesions to complex anomalies.[1] The cause of ARMs is unknown; the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability. In 8% of patients genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs.[2] Anorectal malformation in Currarino syndrome represents the only association for which the gene HLXB9 has been identified.[1][3]
Impetigo is a bacterial infection that involves the superficial skin. The most common presentation is yellowish crust on the face, arms, or legs. Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits.[1] The lesions may be painful or itchy. Fever is uncommon.[2]
Impossible Syndrome, or Chondrodysplasia situs inversus imperforate anus polydactyly, is a complex combination of human congenital malformations (birth defects).[1]
Inborn errors of metabolism form a large class of genetic diseases involving congenital disorders of metabolism. The majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances (substrates) into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic diseases.
Incontinentia pigmenti (IP, also known as "Bloch–Siemens syndrome,"[1] "Bloch–Sulzberger disease,"[2] "Bloch–Sulzberger syndrome"[1] "melanoblastosis cutis," and "nevus pigmentosus systematicus") is a genetic disorder that affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails, and central nervous system. It is named due to its microscopic appearance.
Incontinentia pigmenti achromians (also known as "Hypomelanosis of Ito") is a cutaneous condition characterized by various patterns of bilateral or unilateral hypopigmentation following the lines of Blaschko.[1]:548–9 Though the consistency of the skin findings have led to the term "hypomelanosis of Ito", it actually refers to a group of disorders with various genetic causes including polyploidies and aneuploidies. Based upon the specifics of the genetic defect, the skin findings can be accompanied by a great range of systemic findings. These include central nervous system, ocular, and musculoskeletal defects. Nonetheless, the vast majority of cases are limited to the skin. As opposed to incontinentia pigmenti, hypomelanosis of Ito affects both genders equally.
Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), also called neonatal respiratory distress syndrome,[1] respiratory distress syndrome of newborn, or increasingly surfactant deficiency disorder (SDD),[2] and previously called hyaline membrane disease (HMD), is a syndrome in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also be a consequence of neonatal infection.[3][4] It can also result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant associated proteins. IRDS affects about 1% of newborn infants and is the leading cause of death in preterm infants.[5] The incidence decreases with advancing gestational age, from about 50% in babies born at 26–28 weeks, to about 25% at 30–31 weeks. The syndrome is more frequent in infants of diabetic mothers and in the second born of premature twins.
Infantile apnea is a rare disease that is characterized by cessation of breathing in an infant. It may be related to some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and can cause cyanosis and bradycardia. Infantile apnea can be caused by neurological problems or a physical problem in the airway.[1] In premature infants, it may be treated with caffeine.[2]
Infantile digital fibromatosis (also known as an "Inclusion body fibromatosis," "Infantile digital myofibroblastoma," and "Reye tumor") usually occurs as a small, asymptomatic, nodular, dermal fibrous proliferation at the extensor or lateral surface of a finger or toe.[1]
Infantile myofibromatosis (also known as "Congenital generalized fibromatosis,"[1] and "Congenital multicentric fibromatosis"[1]) is the most common fibrous tumor of infancy, in which eighty percent of patients have solitary lesions with half of these occurring on the head and neck, and 60% are present at or soon after birth.[2]:606
Infective endocarditis is a form of endocarditis. It is an inflammation of the inner tissues of the heart, the endocardium, usually of the valves. It is caused by infectious agents, or pathogens, which are largely bacterial but a few other organisms can also be responsible.[1] Before the age of modern antibiotics it was almost universally fatal.
Inflammatory breast cancer[1] is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer that can occur in women of any age (and, extremely rarely, in men). It is called inflammatory because it frequently presents with symptoms resembling an inflammation. Despite the name, whether inflammation contributes to the development of "inflammatory breast cancer" remains an area of ongoing research.[2] However it can present with very variable signs and symptoms, frequently without detectable tumors and therefore is often not detected by mammography or ultrasound.[3]
Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus.[1] Symptoms can be mild to severe.[2] The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks.[1] In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as "stomach flu" or "24-hour flu".[3] Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure.[2][4]
An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal-cavity contents through the inguinal canal. Symptoms are present in about 66% of affected people. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or bowel movements. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down. Inguinal hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the intestine is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area.[1]
An insulinoma is a tumor of the pancreas that is derived from beta cells and secretes insulin. It is a rare form of a neuroendocrine tumor. Most insulinomas are benign in that they grow exclusively at their origin within the pancreas, but a minority metastasize. Insulinomas are one of the functional PanNET group ("functional" because it increases production of insulin; "PanNET" as an abbreviation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor).[1] In the Medical Subject Headings classification, insulinoma is the only sub-type of "islet cell adenoma".[2]
Intraocular lymphoma is a rare malignant form of eye cancer. Intraocular lymphoma may affect the eye secondarily from a metastasis from a non-ocular tumor or may arise within the eye primarily (primary intraocular lymphoma, PIOL). PIOL is a subset of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL (and PIOL) are most commonly a diffuse large B-cell immunohistologic subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphomas. The most common symptoms of PIOL include blurred or decreased vision due to tumor cells in the vitreous. Most cases of PIOL eventuate to central nervous system involvement (PCNSL) while only 20% of PCNSL lead to intraocular (PIOL) involvement. PIOL and PCNSL remain enigmas because both structures are immunologically privileged sites (the brain sits behind the blood–brain barrier and the retina sits behind the blood-retinal barrier) and so do not normally have immune cells trafficking through these structures. What is more, while the vast majority of PCNSL in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the development of PCNSL and PIOL in immunocompetent patients is unknown and shows no general relation to infectious DNAs.[1]
Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is a type of chronic pain that affects the bladder.[1] Symptoms include feeling the need to urinate right away, needing to urinate often, and pain with sex.[1] IC/BPS is associated with depression and lower quality of life.[3] Many of those affected also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia.[1]
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), or diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD),[1] is a group of lung diseases affecting the interstitium (the tissue and space around the air sacs of the lungs).[2] It concerns alveolar epithelium, pulmonary capillary endothelium, basement membrane, perivascular and perilymphatic tissues. It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage. But in interstitial lung disease, the repair process goes awry and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.
Whipple's disease is a rare, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. First described by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907 and commonly considered a gastrointestinal disorder, Whipple's disease primarily causes malabsorption but may affect any part of the body including the heart, brain, joints, skin, lungs and the eyes.[1] Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and arthritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable and approximately 15% of patients do not have these classic signs and symptoms.[2] Whipple's disease is significantly more common in men, with 87% of the patients being male.[3] When recognized and treated, Whipple's disease can usually be cured with long-term antibiotic therapy; if the disease is left untreated, it is ultimately fatal.
Intestinal spirochetosis, also intestinal spirochetes, colonic spirochetosis and colonic spirochetes, is an infection of the colonic-type mucosa with spirochete microorganisms.
Iodine deficiency is a lack of the trace element iodine, an essential nutrient in the diet. It may result in a goiter, sometimes as an endemic goiter as well as cretinism due to untreated congenital hypothyroidism, which results in developmental delays and other health problems. Iodine deficiency is an important public health issue as it is a preventable cause of intellectual disability.
Iridogoniodysgenesis, dominant type (type 1, IRID1) refers to a spectrum of diseases characterized by malformations of the irido-corneal angle of the anterior chamber of the eye. Iridogoniodysgenesis is the result of abnormal migration or terminal induction of neural crest cells. These cells lead to formation of most of the anterior segment structures of the eye (corneal stroma & endothelium, iris stroma, trabeculum).[1]
sideropenia, hypoferremia
Iron overload, also known as hemochromatosis, indicates accumulation of iron in the body from any cause. The most important causes are hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC), a genetic disorder, and transfusional iron overload, which can result from repeated blood transfusions.[1][2]
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in the pattern of bowel movements without any evidence of underlying damage.[1] These symptoms occur over a long time, often years.[2] It has been classified into four main types depending on if diarrhea is common, constipation is common, both are common, or neither occurs very often (IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M, or IBS-U respectively).[1] IBS negatively affects quality of life and may result in missed school or work.[3] Disorders such as anxiety, major depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome are common among people with IBS.[1][4]
Ischiopatellar dysplasia is a rare autosomal dominant[1] disorder characterized by a hypoplasia of the patellae as well as other bone anomalies, especially concerning the pelvis and feet.[2]
Jackson–Weiss syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Jacobsen Syndrome, also known as 11q deletion disorder, is a rare congenital disorder resulting from deletion of a terminal region of chromosome 11 that includes band 11q24.1. It can cause intellectual disabilities, a distinctive facial appearance, and a variety of physical problems including heart defects and a bleeding disorder. The syndrome was first identified by Danish physician Petra Jacobsen,[1] and is believed to occur in approximately 1 out of every 100,000 births.
Jalili syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the combination of cone-rod dystrophy of the retina and amelogenesis imperfecta.[1] It was characterized in 1988 by Dr. I. K. Jalili and Dr. N. J. D. Smith, following the examination of 29 members of an inbred, Arab family living within the Gaza Strip.[1]
Jansky–Bielschowsky disease is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is part of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) family of neurodegenerative disorders. It is caused by the accumulation of lipopigments in the body due to a deficiency in tripeptidyl peptidase I as a result of a mutation in the TPP1 gene.[1] Symptoms appear between ages 2 and 4 and consist of typical neurodegenerative complications: loss of muscle function (ataxia), drug resistant seizures (epilepsy), apraxia, development of muscle twitches (myoclonus), and vision impairment.[1] This late-infantile form of the disease progresses rapidly once symptoms are onset and ends in death between age 8 and teens.[1] The prevalence of Jansky–Bielschowsky disease is unknown, however NCL collectively affects an estimated 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide.[2] Jansky–Bielschowsky disease is also known as: late-infantile Batten disease, LINCL, or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.[2]
Japanese encephalitis (JE), formerly known as Japanese B encephalitis to distinguish it from Economo's A encephalitis—is a disease caused by the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).[1]
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is a type of long QT syndrome, associated with severe, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Long QT syndrome causes the cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias, can lead to fainting, seizures, or sudden death. It was first described by Anton Jervell and Fred Lange-Nielsen in 1957.[1]
Johanson–Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare, sometimes fatal autosomal recessive multisystem congenital disorder featuring abnormal development of the pancreas, nose and scalp, with mental retardation, hearing loss and growth failure.[1] It is sometimes described as a form of ectodermal dysplasia.[2]
Aphalangy, hemivertebrae and urogenital-intestinal dysgenesis is an extremely rare syndrome, described only in three siblings.[1] It associates hypoplasia or aplasia of phalanges of hands and feet, hemivertebrae and various urogenital and/or intestinal abnormalities. Intrafamilial variability is important as one sister had lethal abnormalities (Potter sequence and pulmonary hypoplasia), while her affected brother was in good health with normal psychomotor development at 6 months of age. Prognosis seems to depend mainly on the severity of visceral malformations. Etiology and inheritance remain unknown.[2][3]
Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum, an area of the brain that controls balance and coordination.
The Jumping Frenchmen of Maine were a group of 19th-century lumberjacks who exhibited a rare disorder of unknown origin. The syndrome entails an exaggerated startle reflex[1] which may be described as an uncontrollable "jump"; individuals with this condition can exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. Jumping Frenchmen syndrome shares some symptoms with other startle disorders.
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IMM) of presumed autoimmune dysfunction resulting in muscle weakness among other complications. It manifests itself in children; it is the pediatric counterpart of dermatomyositis. In JDM, the body's immune system attacks blood vessels throughout the body, causing inflammation called vasculitis. In the United States, the incidence rate of JDMS is approximately 2-3 cases per million children per year. The UK incidence is believed to be between 2-3 per million children per year, with some difference between ethnic groups. The sex ratio (Female : Male) is approximately 2:1. Other Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies include; juvenile polymyositis (PM), which is rare and not as common in children as in adults.
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (also known as "Fibromatosis hyalinica multiplex juvenilis,"[1] "Murray–Puretic–Drescher syndrome"[1]) is a very rare, autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG-2 gene). It occurs from early childhood to adulthood, and presents as slow-growing, pearly white or skin-colored dermal or subcutaneous papules or nodules on the face, scalp, and back, which may be confused clinically with neurofibromatosis.[2]
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), also known as Janz syndrome, is a fairly common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, representing 5-10% of all epilepsy cases. This disorder typically first manifests itself between the ages of 12 and 18 with brief episodes of involuntary muscle twitching occurring early in the morning. Most patients also have generalized seizures that affect the entire brain and many also have absence seizures. Genetic studies have demonstrated at least 6 loci for JME, 4 with known causative genes. Most of these genes are ion channels with the one non-ion channel gene having been shown to affect ion channel currents.[not verified in body]
Juvenile nephronophthisis is the juvenile form of nephronophthisis that causes end stage renal disease around the age of 13; infantile nephronophthisis and adolescent nephronophthisis cause ESRD around the ages of 1 and 19, respectively.
Kabuki syndrome, also previously known as Kabuki makeup syndrome, KMS or Niikawa–Kuroki Syndrome, is a pediatric congenital disorder of suspected genetic origin [1][2] with multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disabilities. It is quite rare, affecting roughly one in 32,000 births.[1] It was identified and described in 1981 by two Japanese groups, led by the scientists Norio Niikawa and Yoshikazu Kuroki.[2] It is named Kabuki Syndrome because of the facial resemblance of affected individuals to stage makeup used in Kabuki, a Japanese traditional theatrical form.
Kallmann syndrome is a rare genetic condition that is characterized by a failure to start or a failure to complete puberty. It is also accompanied by a lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or a highly reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). The condition can occur in both males and females but is more commonly diagnosed in males. Left untreated, patients with Kallmann syndrome will almost invariably be infertile.[1][2]

Kapur–Toriello syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The defining feature of Kapur–Toriello syndrome is abnormal morphology of the columella, which extends below the margin of the nares.[1]
Katz Syndrome is a rare congenital disorder, presenting as a polymalformative syndrome characterized by enlarged viscera, hepatomegaly, diabetes, and skeletal anomalies that result in a short stature, cranial hyperostosis, and typical facial features. It is probably a variant of the autosomal recessive type of Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia.[1]
Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by mental retardation, microbrachycephaly, long narrow face, upslanting palpebral fissures, eye abnormalities, highly arched palate, preauricular skin tags and small mandible.
Kearns–Sayre syndrome (abbreviated KSS), also known as oculocraniosomatic disorder or oculocraniosomatic neuromuscular disorder with ragged red fibers, is a mitochondrial myopathy with a typical onset before 20 years of age. KSS is a more severe syndromic variant of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (abbreviated CPEO), a syndrome that is characterized by isolated involvement of the muscles controlling movement of the eyelid (levator palpebrae, orbicularis oculi) and eye (extra-ocular muscles). This results in ptosis and ophthalmoplegia respectively. KSS involves a combination of the already described CPEO as well as pigmentary retinopathy in both eyes and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Other symptoms may include cerebellar ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, deafness, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and other endocrinopathies.[1] In both of these diseases, muscle involvement may begin unilaterally but always develops into a bilateral deficit, and the course is progressive. This discussion is limited specifically to the more severe and systemically involved variant.
Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a common low-grade (unlikely to metastasize or invade) skin tumour that is believed to originate from the neck of the hair follicle.[1]
Keratoconus (KC, KCN, KTCN) is a disorder of the eye which results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in blurry vision, double vision, nearsightedness, astigmatism, and light sensitivity. Usually both eyes are affected.[3] In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.[4]
Keratolytic Winter erythema (KWE), also known as erythrokeratolysis hiemalis,[1] Oudtshoorn disease[1] and Oudtshoorn skin,[2][3] is a rare autosomal dominant skin disease of unknown etiology which causes erythema (redness) and keratolysis (peeling) of the skin on the palms and soles.[4] Onset, increased prominence and severity usually occurs during winter.[5][6] It is a type of genodermatosis.[7]
Keratomalacia is an eye disorder that results from vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is required to maintain specialized epithelia (such as in the cornea and conjunctiva).
Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (also known as "Siemens-1 syndrome") is a rare X-linked disorder described by Siemens in 1926, a disease that begins in infancy with keratosis pilaris localized on the face, then evolves to more diffuse involvement.[1]:580,762[2]:649,714[3]
Keratosis pilaris (KP) (also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially "chicken skin") is a common, autosomal dominant, genetic follicular condition characterized by the appearance of rough, slightly red bumps on light skin and brown bumps on darker skin.[1] It most often appears on the back, outer sides of the upper arm (though the forearm can also be affected), face, thighs, and buttocks;[1] KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous skin (like the palms or soles of feet).[2] Often the lesions will appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne.[3]
A seborrheic keratosis, also known as seborrheic verruca or a senile wart,[1][2]:767[3]:637 is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumor that originates from cells in the outer layer of the skin (keratinocytes). Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.[4]
Kernicterus is a bilirubin-induced brain dysfunction. Bilirubin is a naturally occurring substance in the body of humans and many other animals, but it is neurotoxic when its concentration in the blood is too high, a condition known as hyperbilirubinemia. Hyperbilirubinemia may cause bilirubin to accumulate in the grey matter of the central nervous system, potentially causing irreversible neurological damage. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from clinically unnoticeable to severe brain damage and even death.
Keutel syndrome (KS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by abnormal diffuse cartilage calcification, hypoplasia of the mid-face, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, hearing loss, short distal phalanges (tips) of the fingers and mild mental retardation.[1][2][3] Individuals with KS often present with peripheral pulmonary stenosis, brachytelephalangism, sloping forehead, midface hypoplasia, and receding chin. It is associated with abnormalities in the gene coding for matrix gla protein (MGP).[1] Being an autosomal recessive disorder, it may be inherited from two unaffected, abnormal MGP-carrying parents. Thus, people who inherit two affected MGP genes will likely inherit KS.
Kikuchi disease or Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was described in 1972 in Japan. It is also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, Kikuchi necrotizing lymphadenitis, phagocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis, and necrotizing lymphadenitis.[1][2][3][4]
Dominant optic atrophy, or dominant optic atrophy, Kjer's type, is an autosomally inherited disease that affects the optic nerves, causing reduced visual acuity and blindness beginning in childhood. This condition is due to mitochondrial dysfunction mediating the death of optic nerve fibers. Dominant optic atrophy was first described clinically by Batten in 1896 and named Kjer’s optic neuropathy in 1959 after Danish ophthalmologist Poul Kjer, who studied 19 families with the disease.[1] Although dominant optic atrophy is the most common autosomally inherited optic neuropathy (i.e., disease of the optic nerves) aside from glaucoma, it is often misdiagnosed.
Kleine–Levin syndrome (KLS), also known as Sleeping Beauty syndrome, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by persistent episodic hypersomnia and cognitive or mood changes. Many patients also experience hyperphagia, hypersexuality and other symptoms. Patients generally experience recurrent episodes of the condition for more than a decade. Individual episodes generally last more than a week but less than a month. The condition greatly affects the personal, professional, and social lives of sufferers, but symptoms spontaneously resolve and seldom cause permanent issues. The severity of symptoms and the course of the syndrome vary between sufferers. Patients commonly have about 20 episodes over about a decade. Several months generally elapse between episodes. The onset of the condition usually follows a viral infection; several different viruses have been observed to trigger KLS. It is generally only diagnosed after similar conditions have been excluded; MRI, CT scans, lumbar puncture, and toxicology tests are used to rule out other possibilities. The syndrome's mechanism is not known, but the thalamus is thought to possibly play a role. Tomography has shown hypoperfusion in the brains of patients during episodes.
Klippel–Feil syndrome is a rare disease, initially reported in 1884 by Maurice Klippel and André Feil from France,[1] characterized by the congenital fusion of any two of the seven cervical vertebrae.[2]:578 The syndrome occurs in a heterogeneous group of patients unified only by the presence of a congenital defect in the formation or segmentation of the cervical spine. Klippel-feil results in limited movement of the neck. Klippel–Feil syndrome is sometimes identified by shortness of the neck, but not all people with this disorder have a visibly shortened neck. Some people with the syndrome have a very low hairline.[3] In 1919, André Feil in his PhD thesis,[4] suggested another classification of the syndrome encompassing not only deformation of the cervical spine but also deformation of the lumbar and thoracic spine.
Klumpke's paralysis (or Klumpke's palsy or Dejerine–Klumpke palsy) is a variety of partial palsy of the lower roots of the brachial plexus.[1][2] The brachial plexus is a network of spinal nerves that originates in the back of the neck, extends through the axilla (armpit), and gives rise to nerves to the upper limb.[3][4][5][6] (see picture - click to enlarge). It is named after Augusta Déjerine-Klumpke.[7][8][9]
Klüver–Bucy syndrome is a syndrome resulting from bilateral lesions of the medial temporal lobe (including amygdaloid nucleus).[1] Klüver–Bucy syndrome may present with hyperphagia, hypersexuality, hyperorality, visual agnosia, and docility.
Kniest Dysplasia is a rare form of dwarfism caused by a mutation in the COL2A1 gene on chromosome 12.[1] The COL2A1 gene is responsible for producing type II collagen. The mutation of COL2A1 gene leads to abnormal skeletal growth and problems with hearing and vision. What characterizes kniest dysplasia from other type II Osteochondrodysplasia is the level of severity and the dumb-bell shape of shortened long tubular bones.[2] This condition was first diagnosed by Dr. Wilhelm Kniest in 1952. Dr. Kniest noticed that his 50 year old patient was having difficulties with restricted joint mobility. The patient had a short stature and was also suffering from blindness. Upon analysis of the patient's DNA, Dr. Kniest discovered that a mutation had occurred at a splice site of the COL2A1 gene. This condition is very rare and occurs less than 1 in 1,000,000 people. Males and females have equal chances of having this condition.[3] Currently, there is no cure for kniest dysplasia. Alternative names for Kniest Dysplasia can include Kniest Syndrome, Swiss Cheese Cartilage Syndrome, Kniest Chondrodystrophy, or Metatrophic Dwarfism Type II.
The Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome is hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by lower extremity or generalized muscular hypertrophy, myxoedema, short stature and cretinism. The absence of painful spasms and pseudomyotonia differentiates this syndrome from Hoffmann syndrome.
Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome (KTS), also called Amelo-cerebro-hypohidrotic syndrome[1] is a rare inherited syndrome characterized by epilepsy, dementia, intellectual disability, and yellow teeth caused by amelogenesis imperfecta (abnormal formation of tooth enamel).[2] It is a type A ectodermal dysplasia.[3]
Koilonychia (from the Greek: koilos-, hollow, onikh-, nail), also known as spoon nails,[1]:782 is a nail disease that can be a sign of hypochromic anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia.[2]:656[3] " It refers to abnormally thin nails (usually of the hand) which have lost their convexity, becoming flat or even concave in shape. In a sense, koilonychia is the opposite of nail clubbing. In early stages nails may be brittle and chip or break easily.
Korsakoff's syndrome is a manifestation of Wernicke's encephalopathy observed in long-term abusers of alcohol. It is rare among the other patients, but, for example, some cases have been observed after bariatric surgeries, when deficiency was not prevented by use of nutritional supplements. This neurological disorder is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the brain, and is also often exacerbated by the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. When Wernicke's encephalopathy accompanies Korsakoff's syndrome the combination is called the Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome; however, a recognized episode of Wernicke's is not always obvious. The syndrome is named after Sergei Korsakoff, a Russian neuropsychiatrist who discovered the syndrome during the late 19th century.
Kostmann syndrome is a group of diseases that affect myelopoiesis, causing a congenital form of neutropenia (severe congenital neutropenia [SCN]), usually without other physical malformations. SCN manifests in infancy with life-threatening bacterial infections.[1]
Kounis syndrome is a group of symptoms that manifests as unstable vasospastic, nonvasospastic angina, or acute myocardial infarction and is triggered by the release of inflammatory mediators following an allergic insult.[1]
Kowarski syndrome[1] describes cases of growth failure (height and bone age two standard deviations below the mean for age), despite the presence of normal or slightly high blood growth hormone by radioimmunoassay (RIA-GH) and low serum IGF1 (formerly called somatomedin), and who exhibit a significant increase in growth rate following recombinant GH therapy.[2]
Kuru is a rare, incurable neurodegenerative disorder which was prevalent among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea in the 1950s and 60s. Kuru is caused by the transmission of abnormally folded prion proteins, which leads to symptoms such as tremors, loss of coordination, and neurodegeneration.
Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein–energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates. Sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption, distinguishes it from marasmus. Kwashiorkor cases occur in areas of famine or poor food supply.[1] Cases in the developed world are rare.[2]
Kyphosis (from Greek κυφός kyphos, a hump) refers to the abnormally excessive convex kyphotic curvature of the spine as it occurs in the cervical, thoracic and sacral regions.[1][2] (Normal inward concave curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis.) Kyphosis can be called roundback or Kelso's hunchback. It can result from degenerative diseases such as arthritis; developmental problems, most commonly Scheuermann's disease; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; Multiple myeloma or trauma. A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st to the 12th vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20° to 45°. When the "roundness" of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called kyphosis or "hyperkyphosis". Scheuermann's kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females.[3]
Labyrinthitis, also known as vestibular neuritis,[1][2] is inflammation of the inner ear. It results in vertigo and also possible hearing loss or ringing in the ears. It can occur as a single attack, a series of attacks, or a persistent condition that diminishes over three to six weeks. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting. Vestibular neuronitis may also be associated with eye nystagmus.
Lachiewicz–Sibley syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by preauricular pits and renal disease. Persons with this disease may have hypoplasic kidneys or proteinuria. This disease was first described in a Caucasian family of British and Irish descent that emigrated to Ohio in the 19th century before settling in Nebraska. Many of the members of this family still live in Nebraska, although the relatives are now scattered throughout the country.
Lafora disease, also called Lafora progressive myoclonic epilepsy or MELF,[1] is a fatal autosomal recessive[2] genetic disorder characterized by the presence of inclusion bodies, known as Lafora bodies, within the cytoplasm of the cells of the heart, liver, muscle, and skin.[3]:545 In a later study, Lafora disease has been and is now viewed as a neurodegenerative disease, since prior to the actual formation of Lafora bodies there has been seen to be an impairment in the development of cerebral cortical neurons. It was further concluded that Lafora disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease and also a glycogen metabolism disorder.[4]
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs. It is the result of an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply).[1] The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million.[2] Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).[3]
Lamellar ichthyosis, also known as ichthyosis lamellaris and nonbullous congenital ichthyosis, is a rare inherited skin disorder, affecting around 1 in 600,000 people.
Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS)—also called infantile acquired aphasia, acquired epileptic aphasia[1] or aphasia with convulsive disorder—is a rare childhood neurological syndrome.
Langer-Giedion Syndrome (LGS), also called trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II (TRPS2) or LGCR (for "Langer-Giedion Chromosome Region"),[1][2] is a very uncommon autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a deletion of chromosomal material. It is named after the two doctors who undertook the main research into the condition in the 1960s. Diagnosis is usually made at birth or in early childhood.
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease involving clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells, abnormal cells deriving from bone marrow and capable of migrating from skin to lymph nodes. Clinically, its manifestations range from isolated bone lesions to multisystem disease. LCH is part of a group of clinical syndromes called histiocytoses, which are characterized by an abnormal proliferation of histiocytes (an archaic term for activated dendritic cells and macrophages). These diseases are related to other forms of abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, such as leukemias and lymphomas.
Larsen syndrome (LS) is a congenital disorder discovered in 1950 by Larsen and associates when they observed dislocation of the large joints and face anomalies in six of their patients.[1] Patients suffering from Larsen syndrome normally present with a variety of symptoms, including congenital anterior dislocation of the knees, dislocation of the hips and elbows, flattened facial appearance, prominent foreheads, and depressed nasal bridges.[2] Larsen syndrome can also cause a variety of cardiovascular[3] and orthopedic abnormalities.[4] This rare disorder is caused by a genetic defect in the gene encoding filamin B, a cytoplasmic protein that is important in regulating the structure and activity of the cytoskeleton.[5] The gene that influences the emergence of Larsen syndrome is found in chromosome region, 3p21.1-14.1, a region containing human type VII collagen gene.[6] Larsen syndrome has recently been described as a mesenchyme disorder that affects the connective tissue of an individual.[2] Autosomal dominant and recessive forms of the disorder have been reported, although most cases are autosomal dominant.[1] Reports have found that in Western societies, Larsen syndrome can be found in one in every 100,000 births, but this is most likely an underestimate because the disorder is frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed.[6]
A laryngeal cleft or laryngotracheoesophageal cleft is a rare congenital abnormality in the posterior laryngo-tracheal wall.[1] It occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 20,000 births.[2] It means there is a gap between the oesophagus and trachea, which allows food or fluid to pass into the airway.[3]
Laryngeal papillomatosis, also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis or glottal papillomatosis or associated with condyloma acuminata, is a rare medical condition (2 per 100,000 adults and 4.5 per 100,000 children),[1]:411 caused by a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the throat.[2]:411 Laryngeal papillomatosis causes assorted tumors or papillomas to develop over a period of time. Without treatment it is potentially fatal as uncontrolled growths could obstruct the airway. Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by HPV types 6 and 11, in which benign tumors form on the larynx or other areas of the respiratory tract. These tumors can recur frequently, may require repetitive surgery, and may interfere with breathing. The disease can be treated with surgery and antivirals. In addition antiangiogenic therapy shows promising results.
Laryngocele refers to a congenital anomalous air sac communicating with the cavity of the larynx, which may bulge outward on the neck. [1]
Laryngomalacia (literally, "soft larynx") is the most common cause of stridor in infancy, in which the soft, immature cartilage of the upper larynx collapses inward during inhalation, causing airway obstruction. It can also be seen in older patients, especially those with neuromuscular conditions resulting in weakness of the muscles of the throat. However, the infantile form is much more common. Laryngomalacia is one of the most common laryngeal congenital disease in infancy and public education about the signs and symptoms of the disease is lacking.
Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Among those who survive about a quarter have deafness which improves over time in about half.[1]
Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathic human genetic disorder that produces many effects and affects many body systems. It is characterized principally by obesity, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, hypogonadism, and renal failure in some cases.[1] Historically, slower mental processing has also been considered a principal symptom but is now not regarded as such.
Lead poisoning is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive.[1] Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet.[2] It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent.[1] In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.[2][1]
Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (LCAT deficiency) is a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism.[1]
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy.
Legionnaires' disease is a form of atypical pneumonia caused by any type of Legionella bacteria.[3] Signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, and headaches.[4] Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur.[1] This often begins two to ten days after being exposed.[4]
Leigh disease (also called Leigh syndrome and subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy ) is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is named after Archibald Denis Leigh, a British neuropsychiatrist who first described the condition in 1951.[2]
A leiomyoma, also known as fibroids, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
Leiomyosarcoma (Gr. "smooth muscle connective tissue tumor"), also referred to as LMS, is a malignant (cancerous) smooth muscle tumor. A benign tumor originating from the same tissue is termed leiomyoma. It is also important to note that while it has been believed that leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas.,[1] there are leiomyoma variants for which classification is evolving. Leiomyoma variants are classified as benign or malignant based upon histological features. The rates have been estimated to be approximately 1:100 for leiomyoma variants and 1:500 for leiomyosarcoma.
Leishmaniasis, also spelled leishmaniosis, is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania and spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies.[2] The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis.[2] The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.[2][3]
Lemierre's syndrome (or Lemierre's disease, also known as postanginal shock including sepsis and human necrobacillosis) refers to thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein.[1] It most often develops as a complication of a bacterial sore throat infection in young, otherwise healthy adults. The thrombophlebitis is a serious condition and may lead to further systemic complications such as bacteria in the blood or septic emboli.
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a difficult-to-treat form of childhood-onset epilepsy that most often appears between the second and sixth year of life. LGS is characterized by a triad of signs including frequent seizures of multiple types, an abnormal EEG pattern of less than 2.5 Hz slow spike wave activity,[1] and moderate to severe intellectual impairment.[2]
Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (or LMS) is a very rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal smallness of one or both eyes (microphthalmos) sometimes with droopy eyelids (blepharoptosis), resulting in visual impairment or blindness. Eye problems may include coloboma, microcornea, and glaucoma. Some affected infants may have complete absence of the eyes (anophthalmia). Most affected infants have developmental delay and intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Other physical abnormalities associated with this disorder can include an unusually small head (microcephaly), and malformations of the teeth, ears, fingers or toes, skeleton, and genitourinary system. The range and severity of findings vary from case to case. Formal diagnosis criteria do not exist.
Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a long-term infection by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae or Mycobacterium lepromatosis.[2][3] Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way for 5 to 20 years.[2] Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes.[2] This may result in a lack of ability to feel pain, thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries or infection due to unnoticed wounds.[4] Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present.[4]
Leptospirosis is an infection caused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called Leptospira. Signs and symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis.[4][5] If the infection causes the person to turn yellow, have kidney failure and bleeding, it is then known as Weil's disease.[5] If it causes lots of bleeding into the lungs then it is known as severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome.[5]
Leri's pleonosteosis is a rare rheumatic condition. It was first described by the French physician Leri in 1921.[1]
Léri–Weill dyschondrosteosis or LWD is a rare pseudoautosomal dominant genetic disorder which results in dwarfism with short forearms and legs (mesomelic dwarfism) and a bayonet-like deformity of the forearms (Madelung's deformity).[1]
Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (LNS), also known as Nyhan syndrome and juvenile gout,[1] is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), produced by mutations in the HPRT gene located on the X chromosome. LNS affects about one in 380,000 live births.[2] The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, who published their findings in 1964.[3]
Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (LCCS1), also called Multiple contracture syndrome, Finnish type,[1] is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by total immobility of a fetus, detectable at around the 13th week of pregnancy. LCCS1 invariably leads to prenatal death before the 32nd gestational week. LCCS1 is one of 40 Finnish heritage diseases. It was first described in 1985 and since then, approximately 70 cases have been diagnosed.[2]
Letterer–Siwe disease is an old name for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), from a time when LCH was thought to be several different diseases; Letterer–Siwe disease, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease, Eosinophilic granuloma and Hashimoto-Pritzker disease. Later they were all put together under the name Histiocytosis X. The X was found to be the Langerhans cell, a dendritic white blood cell. LCH is not believed to be genetic, even though there have been a few reports of more than one person affected by LCH within the same family. Still to this day, the cause is unknown, after researchers have worked very hard on trying to figure it out for decades.
Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells.[2] These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells.[3] Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections.[3] These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells.[3] Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.[3]
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD, also called Arylsulfatase A deficiency) is a lysosomal storage disease which is commonly listed in the family of leukodystrophies as well as among the sphingolipidoses as it affects the metabolism of sphingolipids. Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of myelin, the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. MLD involves cerebroside sulfate accumulation.[1][2] Metachromatic leukodystrophy, like most enzyme deficiencies, has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.[2]
Leukodystrophy is one of a group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the white matter in the brain.[1] The word leukodystrophy comes from the Greek roots leuko, "white", dys, "lack of", and troph, "growth". The leukodystrophies are caused by imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers.
Leukoplakia (also termed leucoplakia,[1] leukokeratosis,[1] leukoplasia,[1] idiopathic leukoplakia,[2] idiopathic keratosis,[3] or idiopathic white patch),[3] normally refers to a condition where areas of keratosis appear as firmly attached white patches on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, although the term is sometimes used for white patches of other gastrointestinal tract mucosal sites, or mucosal surfaces of the urinary tract and genitals.[4][5]
Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition.[1]
Lhermitte–Duclos disease (LDD) (English /ˌlɛərˈmiːtˌduːˈkloʊ/), also called dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, is a rare, slowly growing tumor of the cerebellum, a gangliocytoma sometimes considered to be a hamartoma, characterized by diffuse hypertrophy of the granular layer of the cerebellum. It is often associated with Cowden syndrome.[1] It was described by Jacques Jean Lhermitte and P. Duclos in 1920.[2]
Lichen myxedematosus is a group of cutaneous disorders considered mucinoses.[1][2]:183 Conditions included in this group are:[2]:183
Lichen planus (LP) is an uncommon disease of the skin with a prevalence of 0.1% in men and 0.3% in women. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of an autoimmune process with an unknown initial trigger. There is no cure, but many different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.
Lichen spinulosus (also known as "Keratosis spinulosa"[1]:776) is a rare skin disorder characterized by follicular keratotic papules that are grouped into large patches.[2] It is a variant of keratosis pilaris.
Li–Fraumeni syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary disorder that pre-disposes carriers to cancer development. It was named after two American physicians, Frederick Pei Li and Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., who first recognized the syndrome after reviewing the medical records and death certificates of 648 childhood rhabdomyosarcoma patients.[1] This syndrome is also known as the sarcoma, breast, leukaemia and adrenal gland (SBLA) syndrome.
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) or Erb's muscular dystrophy [1] is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare muscular dystrophies.[2] It is characterised by progressive muscle wasting which affects predominantly hip and shoulder muscles.LGMD has an autosomal pattern of inheritance and currently has no known cure.[3]
Lipodystrophy is a medical condition characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body's adipose tissue. ("Lipo" is Greek for "fat", and "dystrophy" is Greek for "abnormal or degenerative condition".) A more specific term, lipoatrophy, is used when describing the loss of fat from one area (usually the face). This condition is also characterized by a lack of circulating leptin which may lead to osteosclerosis.
Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an endocrine disorder that is an uncommon and potentially lethal form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It arises from defects in the earliest stages of steroid hormone synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone—the first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol.
Liposarcoma is a cancer that arises in fat cells in deep soft tissue, such as that inside the thigh or in the retroperitoneum.[1] Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that bears a resemblance to fat cells when examined under a microscope.[2]
Lissencephaly, which literally means smooth brain, is a rare brain formation disorder caused by defective neuronal migration during the 12th to 24th weeks of gestation resulting in a lack of development of brain folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci).[1] It is a form of cephalic disorder. Terms such as 'agyria' (no gyri) or 'pachygyria' (broad gyri) are used to describe the appearance of the surface of the brain. Children with lissencephaly generally have significant developmental delays, but these vary greatly from child to child depending on the degree of brain malformation and seizure control. Life expectancy can be shortened, generally due to respiratory problems.
Listeriosis is a bacterial infection most commonly caused by Listeria monocytogenes,[1] although L. ivanovii and L. grayi have been reported in certain cases. Listeria primarily causes infections of the central nervous system (meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, cerebritis) and bacteremia in those who are immunocompromised,[2] pregnant women, and those at the extremes of age (newborns and the elderly), as well as gastroenteritis in healthy persons who have been severely infected. Listeria is ubiquitous and is primarily transmitted via the oral route after ingestion of contaminated food products, after which the organism penetrates the intestinal tract to cause systemic infections. The diagnosis of listeriosis requires the isolation of the organism from the blood and/or the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment includes prolonged administration of antibiotics, primarily ampicillin and gentamicin, to which the organism is usually susceptible.
Livedoid dermatitis (also known as "Embolia cutis medicamentosa," and "Nicolau syndrome") is a rare iatrogenic cutaneous reaction that occurs immediately after a drug injection. It presents as an immediate, extreme pain around the injection site, with overlying skin rapidly becoming erythematous, violaceous, or blanched ("ischemic pallor")[1]:124 and sometimes with reticular pattern. The reaction eventually leads to variable degrees of necrosis to the skin and underlying tissue. The wound eventually heals, can lead to atrophic, disfiguring scarring.
Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking. The individual is conscious and sufficiently intact cognitively to be able to communicate with eye movements.[1] Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well.[2] Fred Plum and Jerome Posner coined the term for this disorder in 1966.[3][4] Locked-in syndrome is also known as cerebromedullospinal disconnection,[5] de-efferented state, pseudocoma,[6] and ventral pontine syndrome.
Loin pain hematuria syndrome, or LPHS, is the combination of debilitating unilateral or bilateral flank pain and microscopic or macroscopic amounts of blood in the urine that is otherwise unexplained.[1]
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease and motor neurone disease (MND), is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles.[1][2][3] Some also use the term "motor neuron disease" for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common.[4] ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size.[4] This results in difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and eventually breathing.[2][4]
Lowry–MacLean syndrome is a congenital condition that may be characterized by an ear pit.[1]
Lucey–Driscoll syndrome is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting enzymes involved in bilirubin metabolism. It is one of several disorders classified as a transient familial neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Lujan–Fryns syndrome (LFS), also referred to as X-linked mental retardation with Marfanoid habitus and Lujan syndrome,[1][2][3] is an X-linked genetic disorder that causes mild to moderate intellectual disability and features described as Marfanoid habitus, referring to a group of physical characteristics similar to those found in Marfan syndrome.[4][5] These features include a tall, thin stature and long, slender limbs.[5] LFS is also associated with psychopathology and behavioral abnormalities, and it exhibits a number of malformations affecting the brain and heart.[6][7][8] The disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, and is attributed to a missense mutation in the MED12 gene.[3] There is currently no treatment or therapy for the underlying MED12 malfunction, and the exact etiology of the disorder remains unclear.[9]
Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a medical condition in which the spinal canal narrows and compresses the spinal cord and nerves at the level of the lumbar vertebra. This is usually due to the common occurrence of spinal degeneration that occurs with aging. It can also sometimes be caused by spinal disc herniation, osteoporosis or a tumor. In the cervical (neck) and lumbar (low back) region it can be a congenital condition to varying degrees.
Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma,[1] is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung.[2] If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body.[3] Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas.[4] The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).[5] The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.[6]
Lupus erythematosus is a name given to a collection of autoimmune diseases in which the human immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissues.[1] Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus.
Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia type.[1] The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness, known as erythema migrans, that begins at the site of a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months.[2][3]
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a disease. It is rare, progressive and systemic and typically results in cystic lung destruction. It predominantly affects women, especially during childbearing years.[1]
Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis,[2] is a human disease caused by parasitic worms known as filarial worms.[3] Most cases of the disease have no symptoms.[3] Some people, however, develop a syndrome called elephantiasis, which is marked by severe swelling in the arms, legs, or genitals.[3][4] The skin may also become thicker, and pain may occur. The changes to the body can cause social and economic problems for the affected person.[3]
Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct, then the bloodstream. The condition can be inherited or can be caused by a birth defect, though it is frequently caused by cancer treatments and by parasitic infections. Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can ameliorate symptoms. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection.
Lymphedema–distichiasis syndrome is a medical condition associated with the FOXC2 gene.[1]:849
Lymphocytic colitis is a subtype of microscopic colitis, a condition characterized by chronic non-bloody watery diarrhea.[1][2] The colonoscopy is normal but histology of the mucosal biopsy reveals an accumulation of lymphocytes in the colonic epithelium and connective tissue (lamina propria). Collagenous colitis shares this feature but additionally shows a distinctive thickening of the subepithelial collagen table. The peak incidence of lymphocytic colitis is in persons over age 50; the disease affects women and men equally. Lymphocytic colitis was first described in 1989.[3]
Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors.[1] Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired.[2][3] The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless.[2] The sweats are most common at night.[2][3]
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG or LG) is a very rare lymphoproliferative disorder first characterized in 1972[1] with lymphomatoid meaning lymphoma-like and granulomatosis denoting one of its microscopic characteristics, polymorphic lymphoid infiltrates and focal necrosis within it. While most commonly found in middle age patients,[2] it has been observed in young people with a study identifying 47 cases of patients aged 0–18 years in the literature.[3] Males are found to be affected twice as often as females.[4]
Lyngstadaas Syndrome, also known as severe dental aberrations in familial steroid dehydrogenase deficiency [1], is a rare autosomal recessive liver disease involving an enzyme (steroid dehydrogenase) deficiency and dental anomalies.[2][3] The disease is named after Professor Ståle Petter Lyngstadaas.
Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), also called hyperdibasic aminoaciduria type 2,cationic aminoaciduria or familial protein intolerance, is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder affecting amino acid transport.
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs; /ˌlaɪsəˈsoʊməl/) are a group of approximately 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function.[1] Lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling. This process requires several critical enzymes. If one of these enzymes is defective, because of a mutation, the large molecules accumulate within the cell, eventually killing it.[2]
Macroglobulinemia is the presence of increased levels of macroglobulins in the circulating blood. It is a plasma cell dyscrasia, resembling leukemia, with cells of lymphocytic, plasmacytic, or intermediate morphology, which secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin M component. There is diffuse infiltration by the malignant cells of the bone marrow and also, in many cases, of the spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. The circulating macroglobulin can produce symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome: weakness, fatigue, bleeding disorders, and visual disturbances. Peak incidence of macroglobulinemia is in the sixth and seventh decades of life. (Dorland, 28th ed)
Macrophagic Myofasciitis, or MMF, is a rare muscle disease identified in 1993. The disease is characterized by microscopic lesions found in muscle biopsies that show infiltration of muscle tissue by PAS-positive macrophages.[1] Specific causes of MMF are unknown. Intramuscular injections aluminium-containing vaccines have been implicated.[1] Many of those affected with the disease had previously been treated for malaria with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.[2]
Macular corneal dystrophy, also known as Fehr corneal dystrophy named for German ophthalmologist Oskar Fehr (1871-1959), is a rare pathological condition affecting the stroma of cornea. The first signs are usually noticed in the first decade of life, and progress afterwards, with opacities developing in the cornea and attacks of pain. The condition was first described by Arthur Groenouw in 1890.[1][2]
Macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field.[1] Early on there are often no symptoms. Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes. While it does not result in complete blindness, loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life. Visual hallucinations may also occur but these do not represent a mental illness.[1]
Maffucci syndrome is a sporadic disease characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas associated with multiple hemangiomas.[1][2] Also lymphangiomas may be apparent.[citation needed]
Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations.[1] It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause.[1] People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot.[1] Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present.[2] Major depressive disorder can negatively affects a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health.[1][2] Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide,[3] and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.[4]
Mal de debarquement (or Mal de débarquement) syndrome (MdDS, or common name disembarkment syndrome) is a rare neurological condition usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. The phrase "mal de débarquement" is French for "Sickness from Disembarkation". MdDS is typically diagnosed by a Neurologist or an Ear Nose & Throat Specialist when a person reports a persistent rocking, swaying, or bobbing feeling (though they are not necessarily rocking). This usually follows a cruise or other motion experience. Because most vestibule testing proves to be negative, doctors may be baffled as they attempt to diagnose this rare neurological syndrome. A major diagnostic indicator is that most patients feel better while driving or riding in a car or while in passive motion. The syndrome has recently received increased attention due to the number of people presenting with the condition and more scientific research has commenced now for a number of years to determine what triggers MdDs and how to cure it.
Malakoplakia or malacoplakia (from Greek Malako "soft" + Plako "plaque") is a rare inflammatory condition which makes its presence known as a papule, plaque or ulceration that usually affects the genitourinary tract.[1]:274 However, it may also be associated with other bodily organs. It was initially described in the early 20th century as soft yellowish plaques found on the mucosa of the urinary bladder. Microscopically it is characterized by the presence of foamy histiocytes with basophilic inclusions called Michaelis–Gutmann bodies.
Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type.[1] Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.[2] Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[1] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[2]
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) or malignant hyperpyrexia is a rare life-threatening condition that is usually triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for general anesthesia — specifically the volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocking agent. In susceptible individuals, these drugs can induce a drastic and uncontrolled increase in oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, which overwhelms the body's capacity to supply oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not immediately treated.
Mallory–Weiss syndrome or gastro-esophageal laceration syndrome refers to bleeding from a laceration in the mucosa at the junction of the stomach and esophagus. This is usually caused by severe vomiting because of alcoholism or bulimia,[1] but can be caused by any conditions which causes violent vomiting and retching such as food poisoning. The syndrome presents with painful hematemesis. The laceration is sometimes referred to as a Mallory-Weiss tear.
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency (MCD), or Malonic aciduria is an autosomal-recessive[1] metabolic disorder caused by a genetic mutation that disrupts the activity of Malonyl-Coa decarboxylase. This enzyme breaks down Malonyl-CoA (a fatty acid precursor and a fatty acid oxidation blocker) into Acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide.
Malouf syndrome (also known as "congestive cardiomyopathy-hypergonadotropic hypogonadism syndrome") is a congenital disorder that causes one or more of the following symptoms: mental retardation, ovarian dysgenesis, congestive cardiomyopathy, broad nasal base, blepharoptosis, and bone abnormalities, and occasionally marfanoid habitus (tall stature with long and thin limbs, little subcutaneous fat, arachnodactyly, joint hyperextension, narrow face, small chin, large testes, and hypotonia).[1]
Malpuech facial clefting syndrome, also called Malpuech syndrome or Gypsy type facial clefting syndrome,[1] is a rare congenital syndrome. It is characterized by facial clefting (any type of cleft in the bones and tissues of the face, including a cleft lip and palate), a caudal appendage (a "human tail"),[2][3] growth deficiency, intellectual and developmental disability, and abnormalities of the renal system (kidneys) and the male genitalia.[4] Abnormalities of the heart, and other skeletal malformations may also be present.[5] The syndrome was initially described by Guilliaume Malpuech and associates in 1983.[6] It is thought to be genetically related to Juberg-Hayward syndrome. Malpuech syndrome has also been considered as part of a spectrum of congenital genetic disorders associated with similar facial, urogenital and skeletal anomalies. Termed "3MC syndrome", this proposed spectrum includes Malpuech, Michels and Mingarelli-Carnevale (OSA) syndromes.[7][8] Mutations in the COLLEC11 and MASP1 genes are believed to be a cause of these syndromes.[9] The incidence of Malpuech syndrome is unknown. The pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive, which means a defective (mutated) gene associated with the syndrome is located on an autosome, and the syndrome occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited.[10]
Mandibuloacral dysplasia is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, delayed cranial suture closure, dysplastic clavicles, abbreviated and club-shaped terminal phalanges, acroosteolysis, atrophy of the skin of the hands and feet, and typical facial changes.[1]:576
Mannosidosis is a deficiency in mannosidase, an enzyme.[1]
Mansonelliasis (or mansonellosis) is the condition of infection by the nematode Mansonella.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), comprising about 6% of NHL cases.[1][2] There are only about 15,000 patients presently in the U.S. (The prevalence seems to be somewhat higher in men.)
Marchiafava–Bignami disease is a progressive neurological disease of alcoholism, characterized by corpus callosum demyelination and necrosis and subsequent atrophy.
Marcus Gunn phenomenon, also known as Marcus Gunn jaw-winking or trigemino-oculomotor synkinesis, is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance, in which nursing infants will have rhythmic upward jerking of their upper eyelid. This condition is characterized as a synkinesis: when two or more muscles that are independently innervated have either simultaneous or coordinated movements.[1][2]
Marden–Walker syndrome (MWS) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder.[1][2] It is characterized by blepharophimosis, microcephaly, micrognathia, multiple joint contractures, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, kyphoscoliosis, and delayed motor development and is often associated with cystic dysplastic kidneys, dextrocardia, Dandy-Walker malformation, and agenesis of corpus callosum".[3]
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue.[2] The degree to which people are affected varies. People with Marfan tend to be tall, and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers and toes. They also typically have flexible joints and scoliosis.[2] The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm.[2][3] Other commonly affected areas include the lungs, eyes, bones and the covering of the spinal cord.[2]
Marinesco–Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI,[1] MPS VI, or polydystrophic dwarfism) is a form of mucopolysaccharidosis caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase B (ARSB).[2] It is named after Pierre Maroteaux (1926-) and his mentor Maurice Emil Joseph Lamy (1895-1975), both French physicians.[3][4]
Marshall-Smith Syndrome, discovered in 1971 (Marshall, Graham, Scott, Boner, & Smith), is characterized by unusual accelerated skeletal maturation (usually starting before birth) and symptoms like conspicuous physical characteristics, respiratory difficulties, and mental retardation. Cases described in the literature show a clinical variability regarding related symptoms. For instance, respiratory difficulties are ranging from absent to severe difficulties.[1]

MASA syndrome, also called CRASH syndrome, Gareis-Mason syndrome, L1 syndrome, spastic paraplegia 1[1][2] is a rare X-linked recessive[3] neurological disorder.
Mass psychogenic illness (MPI), also called mass sociogenic illness or just sociogenic illness,[1] is "the rapid spread of illness signs and symptoms affecting members of a cohesive group, originating from a nervous system disturbance involving excitation, loss, or alteration of function, whereby physical complaints that are exhibited unconsciously have no corresponding organic aetiology".[2] MPI is distinct from other collective delusions, also included under the blanket terms of mass hysteria, in that MPI causes symptoms of disease, though there is no organic cause.
Mastocytosis, one of the mast cell diseases, is a rare mast cell activation disorder of both children and adults caused by the presence of too many mast cells (mastocytes) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.[1]
Mastoiditis is the result of an infection that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cell system inside[1] the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear which contains open, air-containing spaces.[2][3] Mastoiditis is usually caused by untreated acute otitis media (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality. With the development of antibiotics, however, mastoiditis has become quite rare in developed countries where surgical treatment is now much less frequent and more conservative, unlike former times.[2] Additionally, there is no evidence that the drop in antibiotic prescribing for otitis media has increased the incidence of mastoiditis. Untreated, the infection can spread to surrounding structures, including the brain, causing serious complications.[4]
Hypermethioninemia is an excess of the amino acid methionine, in the blood. This condition can occur when methionine is not broken down properly in the body.[1]
Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)[1] refers to any of several hereditary forms of diabetes caused by mutations in an autosomal dominant gene[2] (sex independent, i.e. inherited from any of the parents) disrupting insulin production. MODY is often referred to as "monogenic diabetes"[3][4] to distinguish it from the more common types of diabetes (especially type 1 and type 2), which involve more complex combinations of causes involving multiple genes (i.e., "polygenic") and environmental factors. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms. "[5] MODY should not be confused with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) — a form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence than child-onset type 1 DM, and which occurs later in life.
May–Hegglin anomaly (MHA), also known as Dohle leukocyte inclusions with giant platelets and macrothrombocytopenia with leukocyte inclusions,[1] is a rare genetic disorder of the blood platelets that causes them to be abnormally large.
McCune–Albright syndrome, also known as Albright syndrome, is a complex genetic disorder affecting the bone, skin, and endocrine systems.
McGillivray syndrome is a very rare syndrome which is also known as a Craniosynostosis. It is characterized mainly by heart defects, skull and facial abnormalities and ambiguous genitalia. The symptoms of this syndrome are ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, small jaw, undescended testes, and webbed fingers. Beside to these symptoms there are more symptoms which is related with bone structure and misshape. It was first recovered by modern understanding of craniosynostosis is referenced from the 1851 writings of Virchow. His understanding and descriptions of irregular calvarial growth patterns were the basis of the law of Virchow. The patients could be diagnosed by A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the cranial sutures, slow or no growth of the head as the baby grows, development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, and increased pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure). This could be cured by various surgeries.
McKusick–Kaufman syndrome is a genetic condition associated with MKKS.
Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP or MbP) is a term often used when a caregiver or spouse fabricates, exaggerates, or induces mental or physical health problems in those who are in their care, with the primary motive of gaining attention or sympathy from others.[1] Its name is derived from the term Munchausen syndrome, a psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. However, unlike in Munchausen syndrome, in MSbP, the deception involves not themselves, but rather someone under the person's care. MSbP is primarily distinguished from other forms of abuse or neglect by the motives of the perpetrator. Some experts consider it to be an elusive, potentially lethal, and frequently misunderstood form of child abuse[2] or medical neglect.[3] However, others consider the concept to be problematic, since it is based largely on supposition regarding a person's motives, which can be open to radically different interpretations.[4][5]
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum. As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death. In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.[1][2][3][4][5]
Measles is a highly contagious infection caused by the measles virus.[1][2] Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes.[1][3] Two or three days after the start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms.[3] Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days.[4][5] Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others.[4][6] Rubella (German measles) and roseola are different diseases.[7]
Meckel syndrome (also known as Meckel–Gruber Syndrome, Gruber Syndrome, Dysencephalia Splanchnocystica) is a rare, lethal, ciliopathic, genetic disorder, characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, central nervous system malformations (occipital encephalocele), polydactyly (post axial), hepatic developmental defects, and pulmonary hypoplasia due to oligohydramnios.
Brucellosis[2][3] is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from infected animals, or close contact with their secretions.[4]
Medulloblastoma (/məˌdʌloʊblæˈstoʊmə/) is the most common type of pediatric malignant primary brain tumor (cancer), originating in the part of the brain that is towards the back and the bottom, on the floor of the skull, in the cerebellum or posterior fossa.[1]
Megaduodenum is a congenital or acquired dilation and elongation of the duodenum with hypertrophy of all layers that presents as a feeling of gastric fullness, abdominal pain, belching, heartburn, and nausea with vomiting sometimes of food eaten 24 hours prior.[1]
Megaloblastic anemia (or megaloblastic anaemia) is an anemia (of macrocytic classification) that results from inhibition of DNA synthesis during red blood cell production.[1] When DNA synthesis is impaired, the cell cycle cannot progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis (M) stage. This leads to continuing cell growth without division, which presents as macrocytosis. Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset, especially when compared to that of other anemias. The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis, specifically a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid. Vitamin B12 deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate, as the mechanism is loss of B12 dependent folate recycling, followed by folate-deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis (specifically thymine), leading to defects in DNA synthesis. Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B12 prevents this type of anemia (although other vitamin B12-specific pathologies may be present). Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause. Copper deficiency resulting from an excess of zinc from unusually high oral consumption of zinc-containing denture-fixation creams has been found to be a cause.[2]
Meleda disease (MDM) or "mal de Meleda", also called Mljet disease, keratosis palmoplantaris and transgradiens of siemens,[1] (also known as "Acral keratoderma,"[2] "Mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma of the Gamborg-Nielsen type,"[2] "Palmoplantar ectodermal dysplasia type VIII",[2]:508 and "Palmoplantar keratoderma of the Norrbotten type"[3]) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive[4] congenital skin disorder in which dry, thick patches of skin develop on the soles of the hands and feet, a condition known as palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.[5]:214
Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, found in soil and water. It is of public health importance in endemic areas, particularly in Vietnam and northern Australia. It exists in acute and chronic forms. Signs and symptoms may include pain in chest, bones, or joints; cough; skin infections, lung nodules, and pneumonia.
Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome (also termed "Miescher-Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome"),[1] is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurring facial paralysis, swelling of the face and lips (usually the upper lip), and the development of folds and furrows in the tongue.[2]:799 Onset is in childhood or early adolescence. After recurrent attacks (ranging from days to years in between), swelling may persist and increase, eventually becoming permanent. The lip may become hard, cracked, and fissured with a reddish-brown discoloration. The cause of Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition. It has been noted to be especially prevalent among certain ethnic groups in Bolivia. It can be symptomatic of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis.[citation needed]
Melnick–Needles syndrome (MNS), also known as Melnick–Needles osteodysplasty, is an extremely rare congenital disorder that affects primarily bone development. Patients with Melnick–Needles syndrome have typical faces (exophthalmos, full cheeks, micrognathia and malalignment of teeth), flaring of the metaphyses of long bones, s-like curvature of bones of legs, irregular constrictions in the ribs, and sclerosis of base of skull.[1]
Ménière's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear that is characterized by episodes of feeling like the world is spinning (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a fullness in the ear.[3][4] Typically only one ear is affected, at least initially; however, over time both ears may become involved.[3] Episodes generally last from 20 minutes to a few hours.[5] The time between episodes varies.[3] The hearing loss and ringing in the ears may become constant over time.[4]
Meningiomas are a diverse set of tumors arising from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system.[1] Many meningiomas produce no symptoms throughout a person's life, and if discovered, require no treatment other than periodic observation. Typically, symptomatic meningiomas are treated with either radiosurgery or conventional surgery.
Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges.[1] The most common symptoms are fever, headache and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding.[2] If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be accompanied by a characteristic rash.[1][3]
Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability,[2] and mental retardation (MR),[3][4] is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.
Mercury poisoning is a type of metal poisoning, due to exposure to mercury.[2] Symptoms may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing.[1] Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure.[2][3] The effects of long term low dose exposure to methylmercury is unclear.[5] High level exposure to methylmercury is known as Minamata disease. Exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink's disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence.[6]
Mesenteric ischemia is a medical condition in which injury of the small intestine occurs due to not enough blood supply.[1] It can come on suddenly, known as acute mesenteric ischemia, or gradually, known as chronic mesenteric ischemia.[2] Acute disease often presents with sudden severe pain.[2] Symptoms may come on more slowly in those with acute on chronic disease.[1] Signs and symptoms of chronic disease include abdominal pain after eating, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, and being afraid of eating.[1][2]
Mesomelia refers to conditions in which the middle parts of limbs are disproportionately short.[1] When applied to skeletal dysplasias, mesomelic dwarfism describes generalised shortening of the forearms and lower legs. This is in contrast to rhizomelic dwarfism in which the upper portions of limbs are short such as in achondroplasia.
Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium).[1] The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall.[2][3] Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart,[4] or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected.[2][5] Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss.[2] These symptoms typically come on slowly.[6]
Metabolic acidosis is a condition that occurs when the body produces excessive quantities of acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. If unchecked, metabolic acidosis leads to acidemia, i.e., blood pH is low (less than 7.35) due to increased production of hydrogen ions by the body or the inability of the body to form bicarbonate (HCO3−) in the kidney. Its causes are diverse, and its consequences can be serious, including coma and death. Together with respiratory acidosis, it is one of the two general causes of acidemia.
A metabolic disorder can happen when abnormal chemical reactions in the body alter the normal metabolic process.[1] It can also be defined as inherited single gene anomaly, most of which are autosomal recessive.[2]
Metachondromatosis is an autosomal dominant[1]incompletely penetrant[2] skeletal disorder affecting the growth of bones, leading to multiple enchondromas and osteochondromas.[2] This tumor syndrome affects mainly tubular bones, though it can also involve the vertebrae, small joints, and flat bones.[3]
Metageria is a cutaneous condition characterized by premature aging.[1]
Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), also called methylmalonic aciduria,[help 1] is an autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder.[2] It is a classical type of organic acidemia.[3] The result of this condition is the inability to properly digest specific fats and proteins, which in turn leads to a buildup of a toxic level of methylmalonic acid in the blood.[4]
Mevalonate kinase deficiency, also called mevalonic aciduria[1] and hyper immunoglobin D syndrome is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that disrupts the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids.[2]
Michelin tire baby syndrome (also known as "Folded skin with scarring"[1]:625), is characterized by multiple, symmetric, circular skin creases, or bands, on the forearms, lower legs, and often the neck that are present at birth. The creases disappear later in life. But it is a dangerous skin disease as it resides in the body rest of life, it can lead to death. They are reminiscent of these of Bibendum, the mascot of the tire manufacturer, Michelin, hence the name of the syndrome. Associated abnormalities vary and may include facial dysmorphism, upslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, cleft palate, genital anomalies, mild developmental delay, ureterocele, smooth muscle hamartoma, nevus lipomatosus, Laron syndrome (dwarfism with high growth hormone and low somatomedin activity), and other defects.
Michels Caskey syndrome is a rare disorder that combines spinal and skeletal abnormalities, especially of the thumbs, with abnormal or absent female reproductive organs. Examples include the absence of a cervix and upper vagina or abnormalities of the uterus or vagina. Symptoms may also include scoliosis and primary amenorrhea. Synonyms include Mullerian aplasia with hypoplastic thumbs, hypoplastic thumb Mullerian aplasia, and Mullerian aplasia with unilateral hypoplasia of the thumbs and skeletal spine deformities.[1]
Michels syndrome is a syndrome characterised by intellectual disability, craniosynostosis, blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus,[1][2] highly arched eyebrows, and hypertelorism.[2][3] And vary in other symptoms such as asymmetry of the skull, eyelid, and anterior chamber anomalies, cleft lip and palate, umbilical anomalies, and growth and cognitive development.[2][3]
Mickleson syndrome is a very rare congenital condition that is characterized by mental retardation and facial or skull anomalies. It was first described by K.N. Mickleson in 1983.[1]
Micro syndrome also known as WARBM, and Warburg–Sjo–Fledelius syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, microcornea, congenital cataract, intellectual or developmental disability, optic atrophy, and hypogenitalism.[1]
Microcephaly is a medical condition in which the brain does not develop properly resulting in a smaller than normal head.[1] Microcephaly may be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life.[1] Often people with the disorder have an intellectual disability, poor motor function, poor speech, abnormal facial features, seizures, and dwarfism.[1]
Microcephaly lymphoedema chorioretinal dysplasia (MLCRD) is a genetic condition associated with:
Macular hypoplasia, also known as foveal hypoplasia, is a rare medical condition involving the underdevelopment of the macula, a small area on the retina (the eye's internal surface) responsible for seeing in detail. Macular hypoplasia is often associated with albinism.
A microinfarct is a microscopic stroke less than 1 millimeter in size.[citation needed] Microinfarcts can be found in 25-50% of all elderly deceased persons. Microinfarcts may be the second most important cause of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.[1]
Microphthalmia (Greek: μικρός micros = small; ὀφθαλμός ophthalmos = eye), also referred as microphthalmos, is a developmental disorder of the eye in which one (unilateral microphthalmia) or both (bilateral microphthalmia) eyes are abnormally small and have anatomic malformations. It is different from nanophthalmos in which the eye is small in size but has no anatomical alterations. [1]
Microscopic polyangiitis is an ill-defined autoimmune disease characterized by a systemic, pauci-immune, necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis without clinical or pathological evidence of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.
Microsporidiosis is an opportunistic intestinal infection that causes diarrhea and wasting in immunocompromised individuals (HIV, for example). It results from different species of microsporidia, a group of microbial (unicellular) fungi.[1]

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI, also known as incipient dementia, or isolated memory impairment) is a brain function syndrome involving the onset and evolution of cognitive impairments beyond those expected based on the age and education of the individual, but which are not significant enough to interfere with their daily activities.[1] It may occur as a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. Although MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, when memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed "amnestic MCI" and is frequently seen as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease.[2] Studies suggest that these individuals tend to progress to probable Alzheimer’s disease at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year.[2]
Miller–Dieker syndrome (abbreviated MDS), Miller–Dieker lissencephaly syndrome (MDLS), and chromosome 17p13.3 deletion syndrome[1] is a micro deletion syndrome characterized by congenital malformations (a physical defect detectable in an infant at birth which can involve many different parts of the body including the brain, hearts, lungs, liver, bones, or intestinal tract). In this case, it is usually mainly the brain being affected. The congenital malformation can be genetic random and of unknown origin. The malformation is in fact characterized by lissencephaly (smooth brain). MDS is a contiguous gene syndrome, as well, which is a disorder due to the deletion of multiple gene loci that are adjacent to one another. The disorder arises from the deletion of part of the small arm of chromosome 17p (which includes both the LIS1 and 14-3-3 epsilon genes), leading to partial monosomy. There may be unbalanced translocations (i.e. 17q:17p or 12q:17p), or the presence of a ring chromosome 17.
Minamata disease (Japanese: 水俣病, Hepburn: Minamata-byō?), sometimes referred to as Chisso-Minamata disease (チッソ水俣病, Chisso-Minamata-byō?), is a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. Symptoms include ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, loss of peripheral vision, and damage to hearing and speech. In extreme cases, insanity, paralysis, coma, and death follow within weeks of the onset of symptoms. A congenital form of the disease can also affect fetuses in the womb.
Mirhosseini–Holmes–Walton syndrome is a syndrome which involves retinal degeneration, cataract, microcephaly, and mental retardation. It was first characterized in 1972.[1][2]
Mitochondrial disease is a group of disorders caused by dysfunctional mitochondria, the organelles that generate energy for the cell. Mitochondria are found in every cell of the human body except red blood cells, and convert the energy of food molecules into the ATP that powers most cell functions.
Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency is an autosomal recessive fatty acid oxidation disorder[1] that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food . [2][3]People with this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that breaks down a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids.[3]
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) (a.k.a. floppy mitral valve syndrome, systolic click murmur syndrome or billowing mitral leaflet) is a valvular heart disease characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole.[1] It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In its nonclassic form, MVP carries a low risk of complications and often can be kept minimal by dietary attention. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.
In medicine, mixed connective tissue disease (also known as Sharp's syndrome),[1] commonly abbreviated as MCTD, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's defense system attacks itself. It was characterized in 1972,[2] and the term was introduced by Leroy[3] in 1980.[4]
A malignant mixed Müllerian tumor, also known as malignant mixed mesodermal tumor, MMMT and carcinosarcoma, is a malignant neoplasm found in the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes and other parts of the body that contains both carcinomatous (epithelial tissue) and sarcomatous (connective tissue) components. It is divided into two types, homologous (in which the sarcomatous component is made of tissues found in the uterus such as endometrial, fibrous and/or smooth muscle tissues) and a heterologous type (made up of tissues not found in the uterus, such as cartilage, skeletal muscle and/or bone). MMMT account for between two and five percent of all tumors derived from the body of the uterus, and are found predominantly in postmenopausal women with an average age of 66 years. Risk factors are similar to those of adenocarcinomas and include obesity, exogenous estrogen therapies, and nulliparity. Less well-understood but potential risk factors include tamoxifen therapy and pelvic irradiation.[1]
Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder (DSM-IV 315.32)[1] is a communication disorder in which both the receptive and expressive areas of communication may be affected in any degree, from mild to severe.[2]

Möbius syndrome (also spelled Moebius) is an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side. Most people with Möbius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Limb and chest wall abnormalities sometimes occur with the syndrome. People with Möbius syndrome have normal intelligence, although their lack of facial expression is sometimes incorrectly taken to be due to dullness or unfriendliness. It is named for Paul Julius Möbius, a neurologist who first described the syndrome in 1888.[1]
Mohr–Tranebjærg syndrome (MTS) is a rare X-liked recessive syndrome also known as deafness–dystonia syndrome and caused by mutation in the TIMM8A gene. It was first described in 1960.[1] The severity of the symptoms may vary, but they progress usually to severe deafness and dystonia and sometimes are accompanied by cortical deterioration of vision and mental deterioration.
Molluscum contagiosum (MC), sometimes called water warts, is a viral infection of the skin and occasionally of the mucous membranes. MC can affect any area of the skin, but is most common on the trunk of the body, arms, groin, and legs.
Molybdenum cofactor deficiency is a rare human disease in which the absence of molybdenum cofactor leads to accumulation of toxic levels of sulphite and neurological damage. Usually this leads to death within months of birth, due to the lack of active sulfite oxidase. Furthermore, a mutational block in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis causes absence of enzyme activity of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase and aldehyde oxidase.
MOMO syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder which belongs to the overgrowth syndromes and has been diagnosed in only six cases around the world, and occurs in 1 in 100 million births. The name is an acronym of the four primary aspects of the disorder: Macrosomia (excessive birth weight), Obesity, Macrocephaly (excessive head size) and Ocular abnormalities. It is unknown if it is a life-limiting condition. MOMO syndrome was first diagnosed in 1993[1] by Professor Célia Priszkulnik Koiffmann, a Brazilian researcher in the Genetic and Clinical Studies of neurodevelopmental disorders.
Mondini dysplasia, also known as Mondini malformation and Mondini defect, is an abnormality of the inner ear that is associated with sensorineural hearing loss.
Mondor's disease (also known as "Mondor's syndrome of superficial thrombophlebitis"[1]) is a rare condition which involves thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast and anterior chest wall. It sometimes occurs in the arm or penis.[2] In axilla, this condition is known as axillary web syndrome.[3]
Monilethrix (also referred to as beaded hair)[1] is a rare autosomal dominant hair disease that results in short, fragile, broken hair that appears beaded.[2][3] It comes from the Latin word for necklace (monile) and the Greek word for hair (thrix).[4]
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS, unknown or uncertain may be substituted for undetermined), formerly benign monoclonal gammopathy, is a condition in which a paraprotein is found in the blood during standard laboratory blood tests. It resembles multiple myeloma and similar diseases, but the levels of antibody are lower,[1] the number of plasma cells (white blood cells that secrete antibodies) in the bone marrow is lower, it has no symptoms or major problems, although patients with MGUS have sometimes been reported to suffer from peripheral neuropathy,[2] and no treatment is indicated. However, multiple myeloma develops at the rate of about 1.5% a year, so doctors recommend monitoring it yearly. The progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma usually involves several steps. In rare cases, it may also be related with a slowly progressive symmetric distal sensorimotor neuropathy.[3]
Morel's ear is the complete or partial absence of the helix or antihelix of the outer ear. Named after Bénédict Morel, a French psychiatrist who regarded it as one of the hereditary "stigmata of degeneration" that allowed medical professions to identify the mentally ill.[1]
Morquio syndrome (referred to as mucopolysaccharidosis IV, MPS IV, Morquio-Brailsford syndrome, or Morquio)[1] is an autosomal recessive mucopolysaccharide storage disease (see also lysosomal storage disorder), usually inherited.[2]:544 It is a rare type of birth defect with serious consequences. In the US, the incidence rate for Morquio is estimated at between 1 in 200,000 and 1 in 300,000 live births.[1]
A motor neuron disease (MND) is any of several neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body. They include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) and pseudobulbar palsy; spinal muscular atrophies are also sometimes included in the group.[2] They are neurodegenerative in nature and cause increasing disability and eventually, death.[3]
Moyamoya disease is a disease in which certain arteries in the brain are constricted. Blood flow is blocked by the constriction, and also by blood clots (thrombosis).[1]
Müllerian agenesis, also called Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome or MRKH, named after August Franz Josef Karl Mayer, Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, Hermann Küster (1879–1964), and Georges Andre Hauser (1921–2009), is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Müllerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the etiology in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[1] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent.
Muckle–Wells syndrome (MWS), also known as urticaria-deafness-amyloidosis syndrome (UDA),[1] is a rare autosomal dominant disease which causes sensorineural deafness, recurrent hives, and can lead to amyloidosis. Individuals with MWS often have episodic fever, chills, and joint pain. As a result, MWS is considered a type of periodic fever syndrome. MWS is caused by a defect in the CIAS1 gene which creates the protein cryopyrin. MWS is closely related to two other syndromes, familial cold urticaria and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease—in fact, all three are related to mutations in the same gene and subsumed under the term cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS).
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of metabolic disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of lysosomal enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These long chains of sugar carbohydrates occur within the cells that help build bone, cartilage, tendons, corneas, skin and connective tissue. Glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides) are also found in the fluids that lubricate joints.
Mucormycosis is any fungal infection caused by fungi in the order Mucorales.[1]:328 Generally, species in the Mucor, Rhizopus, Absidia, and Cunninghamella genera are most often implicated.[2][3]
Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-related craniosynostosis,[1] is a human specific condition characterized by the premature closure of certain bones of the skull during development, which affects the shape of the head and face. First described by Maximilian Muenke, the syndrome occurs in about 1 in 30,000 newborns. This condition accounts for an estimated 8 percent of all cases of craniosynostosis.
Mulibrey nanism ("MUscle-LIver-BRain-EYe nanism"), also called Perheentupa syndrome and pericardial constriction with growth failure,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder. It causes severe growth failure along with abnormalities of the heart, muscle, liver, brain and eye. TRIM37 is responsible for various cellular functions including developmental patterning.[2][3][4]
Müllerian agenesis, also called Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome or MRKH, named after August Franz Josef Karl Mayer, Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, Hermann Küster (1879–1964), and Georges Andre Hauser (1921–2009), is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Müllerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the etiology in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[1] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent.
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a multisystem disease beginning usually around the age of 50 years, and is twice as common in women.[1]:718[2]
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a progressively worsening condition where muscles in the extremities gradually weaken. The disorder, a pure motor neuropathy syndrome, is sometimes mistaken for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because of the similarity in the clinical picture, especially if muscle fasciculations are present. MMN is thought to be autoimmune. It was first described in the mid-1980s.[1]
Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEI) is a disputed chronic medical condition and syndrome characterized by symptoms that the affected person attributes to low-level chemical exposures to commonly used chemicals. Commonly attributed substances include scented products, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabrics, smoke, petroleum products, and paint fumes. Symptoms are subjective and vague. Symptoms are also non-specific, meaning that they are common symptoms, such as fatigue or headaches, that are present in hundreds of other illnesses. Commonly reported symptoms also include nausea, dizziness, and inflammation of skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract and airways.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1 syndrome) or Wermer's syndrome is part of a group of disorders, the multiple endocrine neoplasias, that affect the endocrine system through development of neoplastic lesions in pituitary, parathyroid gland and pancreas.[1]
Multiple myeloma, also known as plasma cell myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell normally responsible for producing antibodies.[1] Initially, often no symptoms are noticed. When advanced, bone pain, bleeding, frequent infections, and anemia may occur.[2] Complications may include amyloidosis.[3]
Multiple pterygium syndrome is a cutaneous condition inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.[1]
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged.[1] This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.[2][3][4] Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination.[1] MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).[5] Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.[5]
Multiple sulfatase deficiency (also known as "Austin disease,"[1] and "Mucosulfatidosis"[1]) is a very rare autosomal recessive[2]:561 lysosomal storage disease[3] caused by a deficiency in multiple sulfatase enzymes, or in formylglycine-generating enzyme, which activates sulfatases.[4]:502[5] It is similar to mucopolysaccharidosis.[6]
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a degenerative[1] neurological disorder that depicts a group of disorders characterised by the neuronal degeneration mainly in the substantia nigra, striatum, autonomic nervous system and cerebellum. Following a report in 1964 of what was then called striatonigral degeneration, many patients were recognised in whom the changes of striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar degeneration were combined and who had symptoms and signs of cerebellar ataxia and parkinsonian manifestations. More than half of the patients with striatonigral degeneration have orthostatic hypotension, which proves at autopsy to be associated with loss of intermediolateral horn cells (origin of the presynaptic cholinergic sympathetic neurones) and of pigmented nuclei of the brainstem.
Mumps, also known as epidemic parotitis, is a viral disease caused by the mumps virus.[1] Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired.[2] This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands.[3] Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days.[1][2] Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children.[2] About a third of people have mild or no symptoms.[2] Complications may include infections of the covering of the brain (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility.[2] Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility.[3]
Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that results in increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time.[1] The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin.[1] Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs.[2]
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness.[1] The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma.[1]
Mycosis fungoides, also known as Alibert-Bazin syndrome[1] or granuloma fungoides, is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. MF was first recognized in 1806 by a French dermatologist, Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert, at L’hôpital St. Louis in France.[2] It generally affects the skin, but may progress internally over time. Symptoms include rash, tumors, skin lesions, and itchy skin.
Myelitis involves the infection or the inflammation of the white matter or gray matter of the spinal cord which is a part of the central nervous system that acts as a bridge between the brain and the rest of the body. During an inflammatory response in the spinal cord, the myelin and axon may be damaged causing symptoms such as paralysis and sensory loss. Myelitis is classified to several categories depending on the area or the cause of the lesion; however, people often refer to any inflammatory attack on the spinal cord as transverse myelitis.
Myelofibrosis, also known as osteomyelofibrosis, is a relatively rare bone marrow cancer.[1] It is currently classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, in which the proliferation of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and other sites results in fibrosis, or the replacement of the marrow with scar tissue.[2][3]
Myeloperoxidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder featuring deficiency, either in quantity or of function, of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in certain phagocytic immune cells, especially polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Myhre syndrome is a rare genetic disorder.
Myiasis (/ˈmaɪ.əsᵻs/ or /maɪˈaɪ.əsᵻs/) is the parasitic infestation of the body of a live mammal by fly larvae (maggots) that grow inside the host while feeding on its tissue. Although flies are most commonly attracted to open wounds and urine- or feces-soaked fur, some species (including the most common myiatic flies, the botfly, blowfly and screwfly) can create an infestation even on unbroken skin and have been known to use moist soil and non-myiatic flies (such as the common housefly) as vector agents for their parasitic larvae.
Myocarditis, also known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest.[1]
Myoclonic dystonia or Myoclonus dystonia syndrome is a rare movement disorder that induces spontaneous muscle contraction causing abnormal posture. The prevalence of myoclonus dystonia has not been reported, however, this disorder falls under the umbrella of movement disorders which affect thousands worldwide.[1] Myoclonus dystonia results from mutations in the SGCE gene coding for an integral membrane protein found in both neurons and muscle fibers. Those suffering from this disease exhibit symptoms of rapid, jerky movements of the upper limbs (myoclonus), as well as distortion of the body's orientation due to simultaneous activation of agonist and antagonist muscles (dystonia).
Myoclonic epilepsy refers to a family of epilepsies that present with myoclonus. When myoclonic jerks are occasionally associated with abnormal brain wave activity, it can be categorized as myoclonic seizure. If the abnormal brain wave activity is persistent and results from ongoing seizures, then a diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy may be considered.
Unverricht–Lundborg disease (abbreviated ULD or EPM1) is the most common form of an uncommon group of genetic epilepsy disorders called the progressive myoclonus epilepsies.[1] It is caused due to a mutation in the cystatin B gene (CSTB).[2] The disease is named after Heinrich Unverricht, who first described it in 1891, and Herman Bernhard Lundborg, who researched it in greater detail in 1903. ULD onsets in children between the ages of 6 and 16; there are no known cases in which the person was older than 18.[3] Most cases originate from the Baltic region of Europe, though many have been reported from countries in the Mediterranean.[2]
Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary twitching of a muscle or a group of muscles. It describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus). The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk). Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy persons and are experienced occasionally by everyone. However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders. Hiccups are a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm. When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a provoked spasm. Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.
Myoglobinuria is the presence of myoglobin in the urine, usually associated with rhabdomyolysis or muscle destruction. Myoglobin is present in muscle cells as a reserve of oxygen.
X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is a rare childhood onset disease characterized by slow progressive vacuolation and atrophy of skeletal muscle. There is no known cardiac or intellectual involvement.
Myopathy is a muscular disease[1] in which the muscle fibers do not function for any one of many reasons, resulting in muscular weakness. "Myopathy" simply means muscle disease (Greek myo- "muscle" + patheia < -pathy "suffering"). This meaning implies that the primary defect is within the muscle, as opposed to the nerves ("neuropathies" or "neurogenic" disorders) or elsewhere (e.g., the brain). Muscle cramps, stiffness, and spasm can also be associated with myopathy.
Myositis ossificans comprises two syndromes characterized by heterotopic ossification (calcification) of muscle.
Myositis is a general term for inflammation or swelling of the muscles. Injury, medicines, infection, or an immune disorder can lead to myositis.[1] It is e.g. a documented side effect of the lipid-lowering drugs statins and fibrates.
Myxedema or myxoedema is a term used synonymously with severe hypothyroidism. However, the term is also used to describe a dermatological change that can occur in hypothyroidism and some forms of hyperthyroidism.
A myxoid liposarcoma is a malignant adipose tissue neoplasm[1] of myxoid appearance histologically.
Myxozoa (etymology: Greek: μύξα myxa "slime" or "mucus"[1] + thematic vowel o + ζῷον zoon "animals"[2]) is a group of aquatic, obligately parasitic cnidarian animals. Over 1300 species have been described[3] and many have a two-host lifecycle, involving a fish and an annelid worm or a bryozoan. The average size of a myxosporean spore usually ranges from 10 μm to 20 μm,[4] whereas that of a malacosporean spore can be up to 2 mm. Myxozoans can live in both freshwater and marine habitats.
N-Acetylglutamate synthase (or synthetase) deficiency is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder.
Naegeli–Franceschetti–Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS), also known as chromatophore nevus of Naegeli and Naegeli syndrome,[1][2] is a rare autosomal dominant[3] form of ectodermal dysplasia, characterized by reticular skin pigmentation, diminished function of the sweat glands, the absence of teeth and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. One of the most striking features is the absence of fingerprint lines on the fingers.
Nail–patella syndrome (NPS) (also known as "HOOD syndrome") is a genetic disorder that results in small, poorly developed nails and kneecaps, but can also affect many other areas of the body, such as the elbows, chest, and hips. The name "nail–patella" can be very misleading because the syndrome often affects many other areas of the body, including even the production of certain proteins.[1]:666 Those affected by NPS may have one or more affected areas of the body, and its severity varies depending on the individual. It is also referred to as iliac horn syndrome, hereditary onychoosteodysplasia (HOOD syndrome), Fong disease or Turner–Kieser syndrome.[2]
Nakajo syndrome, also called nodular erythema with digital changes,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder first reported in 1939 by A. Nakajo in the offspring of consanguineous (blood relative) parents.[2][3] The syndrome can be characterized by erythema (reddened skin), loss of body fat in the upper part of the body, and disproportionately large eyes, ears, nose, lips, and fingers.[1]
Nance–Horan syndrome is a rare X linked syndrome characterized by congenital cataract leading to profound vision loss, characteristic dysmorphic features and dental anomalies.[1][2] Microcornea, microphthalmia and mild or moderate mental retardation may accompany these features. Heterozygous females often manifest similarly but with less severe features than affected males.
Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others' feelings.[4][5] People affected by it often spend a lot of time thinking about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.[5]
Narcolepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles.[1] Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of people also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy sleep about the same number of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse.[1]
Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, also called Keipert syndrome, is a rare congenital syndrome first described by J.A. Keipert and colleagues in 1973. The syndrome is characterized by a mishaped nose, broad thumbs and halluces (the big toes), brachydactyly, sensorineural hearing loss, facial features such as hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), and developmental delay. It is believed to be inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, which means a genetic mutation causing the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and while two copies of the mutated gene must be inherited for a female to be born with the disorder, just one copy is sufficient to cause a male to be born with the disorder. Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome is likely caused by a mutated gene located on the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2–q28. The incidence of the syndrome has not been determined, but it is considered to affect less than 200,000 people in the United States, and no greater than 1 per 2,000 in Europe. It is similar to Keutel, Muenke, Rubinstein and Teunissen-Cremers syndrome.[1][2][3][4][5]
Necrotising fasciitis (NF), commonly known as flesh-eating disease, is an infection that results in the death of the body's soft tissue.[3] It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly. Symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, fever, and vomiting.[3] The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and perineum.[2]
Neisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx.[1] As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form.[2] N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing on toys and even freshwater. It infects the cell by sticking to it with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors.

Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a monogenic form of diabetes that occurs in the first 6 months of life. It is a rare disease, occurring in only one in 100,000 to 500,000 live births. Infants with NDM do not produce enough insulin, leading to an increase in blood glucose. NDM can be mistaken for the much more common type 1 diabetes, but type 1 diabetes usually occurs later than the first 6 months of life. In about half of those with NDM, the condition is lifelong and is called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). In the rest of those with NDM, the condition is transient and disappears during infancy but can reappear later in life; this type of NDM is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). Specific genes that can cause NDM have been identified.[1]
A newly identified and potentially treatable form of monogenic diabetes is the neonatal diabetes caused by activating mutations of the KCNJ11 gene, which codes for the Kir6.2 subunit of the beta cell KATP channel.[1][2] This disease is considered to be a type of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a form of diabetes mellitus presenting at birth that is not permanent. This disease is considered to be a type of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
Neonatal Hemochromatosis is a rare and severe liver disease of unknown origin, though research suggests that it may be alloimmune condition. Its characteristics are similar to hereditary hemochromatosis, where iron deposition causes damage to the liver and other organs and tissues.
Neonatal hepatitis is a form of hepatitis that affects the fetuses and neonates
Neonatal infections are infections of the neonate (newborn) during the neonatal period or first four weeks after birth.[1] Neonatal infections may be contracted by transplacental transfer in utero, in the birth canal during delivery (perinatal), or by other means after birth.[2] Some neonatal infections are apparent soon after delivery, while others may develop postpartum within the first week or month. Some infections acquired in the neonatal period do not become apparent until much later such as HIV, hepatitis B and malaria.
Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words νεκρός (nekros; "dead") and φιλία (philia; "love").[1]
Ascites is a gastroenterological term for an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity that exceeds 25 mL.[1]
Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults.[1] It is named after Dr. Max Wilms, the German surgeon (1867–1918) who first described it.[2]
Nephrocalcinosis, once known as Albright's calcinosis after Fuller Albright, or Anderson-Carr kidneys, is a term originally used to describe deposition of calcium salts in the renal parenchyma due to hyperparathyroidism. It is now more commonly used to describe diffuse, fine, renal parenchymal calcification on radiology.[1] During its early stages, nephrocalcinosis is visible on x-ray, and appears as a fine granular mottling over the renal outlines. These outlines eventually come together to form a dense mass.[2] It is most commonly seen as an incidental finding with medullary sponge kidney on an abdominal x-ray. However, it may be severe enough to cause (as well as be caused by) renal tubular acidosis or even end stage renal failure, due to disruption of the renal tissue by the deposited calcium.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (also known as peripheral diabetes insipidus) is a form of diabetes insipidus primarily due to pathology of the kidney. This is in contrast to central/neurogenic diabetes insipidus, which is caused by insufficient levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/Arginine Vasopressin (AVP). Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to ADH, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.
Nephronophthisis is a genetic disorder of the kidneys which affects children.[1] It is classified as a medullary cystic kidney disease. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and, although rare, is the most common genetic cause of childhood kidney failure. It is a form of ciliopathy.[2] Its incidence has been estimated to be 0.9 cases per million people in the United States, and 1 in 50,000 births in Canada.[3]
Hyperparathyroidism is an increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood.[1] This occurs either from the parathyroid glands inappropriately making too much PTH (primary hyperparathyroidism) or other events triggering increased production by the parathyroid glands (secondary hyperparathyroidism).[2] Most people with primary disease have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis.[3] In those with symptoms the most common is kidney stones with other potential symptoms including weakness, depression, bone pains, confusion, and increased urination.[2][4] Both types increase the risk of weak bones.[4][3]
Hyperuricemia is an abnormally high level of uric acid in the blood. In the pH conditions of body fluid, uric acid exists largely as urate, the ion form.[1][2] The amount of urate in the body depends on the balance between the amount of purines eaten in food, the amount of urate synthesised within the body (e.g., through cell turnover), and the amount of urate that is excreted in urine or through the gastrointestinal tract.[2] In humans, the upper end of the normal range is 360 µmol/L (6 mg/dL) for women and 400 µmol/L (6.8 mg/dL) for men.[3]
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint.[3] Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours.[5] The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases.[6] It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.[5]
Nephrotic syndrome is a syndrome comprising signs of nephrosis, chiefly proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema.[1][2] It is a component of glomerulonephrosis, in which different degrees of proteinuria occur.[1] Essentially, loss of protein through the kidneys (proteinuria) leads to low protein levels in the blood (hypoproteinemia including hypoalbuminemia), which causes water to be drawn into soft tissues (edema). Severe hypoalbuminemia can also cause a variety of secondary problems, such as water in the abdominal cavity (ascites), around the heart or lung (pericardial effusion, pleural effusion), high cholesterol (hence hyperlipidemia), loss of molecules regulating coagulation (hence increased risk of thrombosis).

A nerve sheath tumor is a type of tumor of the nervous system (nervous system neoplasm) which is made up primarily of the myelin surrounding nerves.
Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to excessive function of pancreatic beta cells with an abnormal microscopic appearance. The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century. The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement, islet cell dysplasia, beta cells budding from ductal epithelium, and islets in apposition to ducts.
Netherton syndrome is a severe, autosomal recessive[1] form of ichthyosis associated with mutations in the SPINK5 gene.[2][3] It is named after Earl W. Netherton (1910–1985), an American dermatologist who discovered it in 1958.[4]
Ichthyosis (plural ichthyoses) is a heterogeneous family of at least 28,[1] generalized, mostly genetic skin disorders.
Neurasthenia is a term that was first used at least as early as 1829 to label a mechanical weakness of the actual nerves, rather than the more metaphorical "nerves" referred to by George Miller Beard later.
Neuroacanthocytosis is a label applied to several neurological conditions in which the blood contains misshapen, spiculated red blood cells called acanthocytes.
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a type of cancer that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most frequently starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.[1]
Neurocutaneous melanosis is a congenital disorder characterized by the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the leptomeninges of the central nervous system.[1] These lesions may occur in the amygdala, cerebellum, cerebrum, pons, and spinal cord of patients. Although typically asymptomatic, malignancy occurs in the form of leptomeningeal melanoma in over half of patients.[2] Regardless of the presence of malignancy, patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis generally have a poor prognosis with few treatment options.[3] The pathogenesis of neurocutaneous melanosis is believed to be related to the abnormal postzygotic development of melanoblasts and mutations of the NRAS gene.[4]
Neurocysticercosis is a specific form of the infectious parasitic disease cysticercosis which is caused by infection with Taenia solium, a tapeworm found in pigs. Neurocysticercosis occurs when cysts formed by the infection grow within the brain causing neurologic syndromes such as epileptic seizures. It has been called a "hidden epidemic"[1] and "arguably the most common parasitic disease of the human nervous system".[2]
Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a malignant (cancerous) neural crest tumor.[1] It is a rare tumor, usually occurring in children and young adults under 25 years of age. The overall 5 year survival rate is about 53%.[2]
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. Many are benign, while some are malignant. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung and the rest of the body.

A neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system. In 90% of cases they're found as stand-alone tumors, while the remainder are found in persons with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetically inherited disease, they can result in a range of symptoms from physical disfiguration and pain to cognitive disability. Neurofibromas arise from nonmyelinating-type Schwann cells that exhibit biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene that codes for the protein neurofibromin.[1] This protein is responsible for regulating the RAS-mediated cell growth signaling pathway. In contrast to schwannomas, another type of tumor arising from Schwann cells, neurofibromas incorporate many additional types of cells and structural elements in addition to Schwann cells, making it difficult to identify and understand all the mechanisms through which they originate and develop.[2]
Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of three conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The three types are neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis.[1] In NF1 symptoms include light brown spots on the skin, freckles in the armpit and groin, small bumps within nerves, and scoliosis. In NF2 there may be hearing loss, cataracts at a young age, balance problems, flesh colored skin flaps, and muscle wasting.[2] The tumors are generally non cancerous.[1]
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening neurological disorder most often caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs. NMS typically consists of muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability,[1] and cognitive changes such as delirium, and is associated with elevated plasma creatine phosphokinase.[2] The incidence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome has decreased since it was first described, due to changes in prescribing habits, but NMS is still a potential danger to patients being treated with antipsychotic medication. Because of the unpredictability of NMS, treatment may vary substantially but is generally based on supportive care and removal of the offending antipsychotic drug, and preserving kidney function with good hydration and diuresis.
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is the general name for a family of at least eight genetically separate neurodegenerative disorders that result from excessive accumulation of lipopigments (lipofuscin) in the body's tissues.[1] These lipopigments are made up of fats and proteins. Their name comes from the word stem lipo-, which is a variation on "lipid" or "fat", and from the term pigment, used because the substances take on a greenish-yellow color when viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. These lipofuscin materials build up in neuronal cells and many organs, including the liver, spleen, myocardium, and kidneys.
Neurosyphilis is an infection of the brain or spinal cord caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It usually occurs in people who have had chronic, untreated syphilis, usually about 10 to 20 years after first infection[1] and develops in about 25%–40% of persons who are not treated.[2] The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of a syphilis infection.[3]
Nevo Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually begins during the later stages of pregnancy.[1] Nevo Syndrome is caused by a NSD1 deletion, which encodes for methyltransferase involved with chromatin regulation. The exact mechanism as to how the chromatin is changed is unknown and still being studied.[2] Nevo Syndrome is an example of one of about twelve overgrowth syndromes known today.[3] Overgrowth syndromes are characterized with children experiencing a significant overgrowth during pregnancy and also excessive postnatal growth.[4] Studies concerning Nevo Syndrome have shown a similar relation to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder.[3] Nevo Syndrome is associated with kyphosis, an abnormal increased forward rounding of the spine,[5] joint laxity, postpartum overgrowth, a highly arched palate, undescended testes in males, low-set ears,[3] increased head circumference,[4] among other symptoms.
Nezelof syndrome (also known as "Thymic dysplasia with normal immunoglobulins"[1]:85) is an autosomal recessive[2] congenital immunodeficiency condition due to underdevelopment of the thymus. An association with CD44 has been proposed.[3]
Nicolaides–Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS) is a rare genetic condition caused by de novo missense mutations in the SMARCA2 gene and has only been reported in less than 100 cases worldwide.[1] NCBRS is a distinct condition and well recognizable once the symptoms have been identified.
Nicotine withdrawal is a group of symptoms that occur in the first few weeks upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake of nicotine. Symptoms include cravings for nicotine, anger/irritability, anxiety, depression, impatience, trouble sleeping, restlessness, hunger or weight gain, and difficulty concentrating.[1] A quit smoking program may improve one’s chance for success in quitting nicotine.[1] Nicotine withdrawal is recognized in both the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the WHO International Classification of Diseases.

Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), also known as Berlin breakage syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia variant 1 (AT-V1) and Seemanova syndrome,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive[2] congenital disorder causing chromosomal instability, probably as a result of a defect in the Double Holliday junction DNA repair mechanism and/or the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing mechanism for repairing double strand breaks in DNA (see Homologous recombination).[3]
Olney's lesions, also known as NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity (NAN), are a potential form of brain damage. They are named after John Olney, who conducted a study in 1989 to investigate neurotoxicity caused by PCP and related drugs.[1]
Nocardiosis is an infectious disease affecting either the lungs (pulmonary nocardiosis) or the whole body (systemic nocardiosis). It is due to infection by bacterium of the genus Nocardia, most commonly Nocardia asteroides or Nocardia brasiliensis.
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is hearing impairment resulting from exposure to loud sound. People may have a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies, impaired cognitive perception of sound, or other impairment, including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears.[1]
Noma (also referred to as cancrum oris, fusospirochetal gangrene, necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis, stomatitis gangrenosa)[1] is a rapidly progressive, polymicrobial, often gangrenous infection of the mouth or genitals.
Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (non-24), is one of several chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs). It is defined as a "chronic steady pattern comprising [...] daily delays in sleep onset and wake times in an individual living in society."[1] Symptoms result when the non-entrained (free-running) endogenous circadian rhythm drifts out of alignment with the light/dark cycle in nature.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas.[1] Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing.[1]
Bejel, or endemic syphilis, is a chronic skin and tissue disease caused by infection by the endemicum subspecies of the spirochete Treponema pallidum.
Considered to be neurologically based,[1][2][3] nonverbal learning disorder, otherwise known as nonverbal learning disability (NLD or NVLD), is characterized by verbal strengths as well as visual-spatial, motor, and social skills difficulties.[4][5] People with this disorder may not at times comprehend nonverbal cues such as facial expression or tone of voice.[6] Challenges with mathematics and handwriting are common.[7]
Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common autosomal dominant congenital disorder and is named after Jacqueline Noonan, a pediatric cardiologist. It is referred to as the male version of Turner's syndrome;[1][2] however, the genetic causes of Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome are distinct. The principal features include congenital heart defect (typically pulmonary valve stenosis; also atrial septal defect and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), short stature, learning problems, pectus excavatum, impaired blood clotting, and a characteristic configuration of facial features including a webbed neck and a flat nose bridge. NS is a RASopathy, and is one of several disorders that are caused by a disruption of RAS-MAPK signaling pathway.
Norrie disease is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the eye and almost always leads to blindness. In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, some patients suffer from a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, while another portion may be mentally challenged.
Northern epilepsy syndrome or progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR) is a subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and a rare disease that is regarded as a Finnish heritage disease. Unlike most Finnish heritage diseases, this syndrome has been reported only in Finland.[1] The disease is characterized by seizures in early childhood that progressively get worse until after puberty. Once the onset of seizures occurs, mental degradation is seen. This continues into adulthood even after seizure frequency has decreased. The cause of the disease is a missense mutation in chromosome 8. The creation of a new protein occurs and the lipid content of the brain is altered because of it. The ratio of the mutation carriers is 1:135. There is nothing that has been found to stop the progression of the disease, but symptomatic approaches, such as the use of benzodiazepines, have helped control seizures.[2][3][4]
Notalgia paraesthetica (NP) or notalgia paresthetica (also known as "Hereditary localized pruritus", "Posterior pigmented pruritic patch", and "Subscapular pruritus"[1]) is a chronic sensory neuropathy. Notalgia paraesthetica is a common localized itch, affecting mainly the interscapular area (especially the T2–T6 dermatomes) but occasionally with a more widespread distribution, involving the shoulders, back, and upper chest.[2]:402 The characteristic symptom is pruritus (itch or sensation that makes a person want to scratch) on the back, usually on the left hand side below the shoulder blade (mid to upper back). It is occasionally accompanied by pain, paresthesia (pins and needles), or hyperesthesia (unusual or pathologically increased sensitivity of the skin to sensory stimuli, such as pain, heat, cold, or touch), which results in a well circumscribed hyperpigmentation of a skin patch in the affected area.
Nyctophobia is a phobia characterized by a severe fear of the dark. It is triggered by the brain’s disfigured perception of what would, or could, happen when in a dark environment. It can also be temporarily triggered if the mind is unsteady or scared about recent events or ideas, or a partaking in content the brain considers a threat (examples could include indulging in horror content, witnessing vulgar actions, or having linked dark environments to prior events or ideas that disturb the mind).
Nystagmus is a condition of involuntary (or voluntary, in rare cases)[1] eye movement, acquired in infancy or later in life, that may result in reduced or limited vision.[2] Due to the involuntary movement of the eye, it is often called "dancing eyes".[3][a]
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called "rituals"), or have certain thoughts repeatedly. People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.[1] Often they take up more than an hour a day.[2] Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.[1] The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of suicide.[2][3]
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a general pattern of concern with orderliness, perfectionism, excessive attention to details, mental and interpersonal control, and a need for control over one's environment, at the expense of flexibility, openness to experience, and efficiency. Workaholism and miserliness are also seen often in those with this personality disorder.[2] Rituals are performed to the point of excluding leisure activities and friendships. Persons affected with this disorder may find it hard to relax, always feeling that time is running out for their activities, and that more effort is needed to achieve their goals. They may plan their activities down to the minute—a manifestation of the compulsive tendency to keep control over their environment and to dislike unpredictable things as things they cannot control.[2]
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by complete or partial obstructions of the upper airway. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of shallow or paused breathing during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation. These episodes of decreased breathing, called "apneas" (literally, "without breath"), typically last 20 to 40 seconds.[1]
Occipital horn syndrome (OHS), formerly considered a variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,[1] is an X-linked recessive connective tissue disorder. It is caused by a deficiency in the transport of the essential mineral copper, associated with mutations in the ATP7A gene.[2][3] Only about 2/3 of children with OHS are thought to have genetically inherited the disorder; the other 1/3 do not have the disease in their family history. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive the disease affects more males. This is because they do not have a second X chromosome, unlike females, so essentially are lacking the 'backup' copy with proper function. Females are much more likely to be carriers only. For a female to be affected they must carry two defective X chromosomes, not just one.[4] The disorder is considered a milder variant of Menkes disease.[5]
Occupational asthma is an occupational lung disease and a type of asthma. Like other types of asthma, it is characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airways obstruction, and bronchospasm, but it is caused by something in the workplace environment.[1]

Ochronosis is a syndrome caused by the accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues. It was first described by Rudolf Virchow in 1865.[1] The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light-scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.
Ocular albinism is a form of albinism which, in contrast to oculocutaneous albinism, presents primarily in the eyes.[1] There are multiple forms of ocular albinism, which are clinically similar.[2]:865
Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome (also known as "Delleman–Oorthuys syndrome"[1]) is a condition characterized by orbital cysts, microphthalmia, porencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and facial skin tags.[1]
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome (also called Lowe syndrome) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hypotonia, intellectual disability, proximal tubular acidosis, aminoaciduria, and low-molecular-weight proteinuria. Lowe syndrome can be considered a cause of Fanconi syndrome (bicarbonaturia, renal tubular acidosis, potassium, and sodium[1]).[2][3]
Oculomotor nerve palsy or third nerve palsy is an eye condition resulting from damage to the third cranial nerve or a branch thereof. As the name suggests, the oculomotor nerve supplies the majority of the muscles controlling eye movements. Thus, damage to this nerve will result in the affected individual being unable to move his or her eye normally. In addition, the nerve also supplies the upper eyelid muscle (levator palpebrae superioris) and the muscles responsible for pupil constriction (sphincter pupillae) . The limitations of eye movements resulting from the condition are generally so severe that the affected individual is unable to maintain normal alignment of their eyes when looking straight ahead, leading to strabismus and, as a consequence, double vision (diplopia).
Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare form of muscular dystrophy with symptoms generally starting when an individual is 40 to 50 years old. It can be autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease or autosomal recessive. The most common inheritance of OPMD is autosomal dominant, which means only one copy of the mutated gene needs to be present in each cell. Children of an affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant gene.[1]
An odontoma (also termed odontome)[1][2] is a benign tumour[3] of odontogenic origin (i.e. linked to tooth development).[4] Specifically, it is a dental hamartoma, meaning that it is composed of normal dental tissue that has grown in an irregular way.
In psychiatry, oikophobia (synonymous with domatophobia and ecophobia)[1] is an aversion to home surroundings. It can also be used more generally to mean an abnormal fear (a phobia) of the home, or of the contents of a house ("fear of household appliances, equipment, bathtubs, household chemicals, and other common objects in the home").[2] The term derives from the Greek words oikos, meaning household, house, or family, and phobia, meaning "fear".
Oligodactyly (from the Ancient Greek oligos meaning "few" and δάκτυλος daktylos meaning "finger") is the presence of fewer than five fingers or toes on a hand or foot.[1][2]
Oliver–McFarlane syndrome is a condition characterized by hypertrichosis of the eyebrows and eyelashes.[1]
Olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) is the degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain – the cerebellum, pons, and inferior olives.[1] OPCA is present in several neurodegenerative syndromes, including inherited and non-inherited forms of ataxia (such as the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia known as Machado–Joseph disease) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), with which it is primarily associated.[1]
Ollier disease is a rare nonhereditary sporadic disorder where intraosseous benign cartilaginous tumors (enchondroma) develop close to growth plate cartilage. Prevalence is estimated at around 1 in 100,000.[1]
Olney's lesions, also known as NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity (NAN), are a potential form of brain damage. They are named after John Olney, who conducted a study in 1989 to investigate neurotoxicity caused by PCP and related drugs.[1]
Omenn syndrome is an autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency[1] associated with hypomorphic missense mutations in immunologically relevant genes of T-cells (and B-cells) such as recombination activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2), IL-7 Receptor α gene (IL7Rα), DCLRE1C-Artemis, RMRP-CHH, DNA-Ligase IV, common gamma chain, WHN-FOXN1, ZAP-70 and complete DiGeorge anomaly (DiGeorge Syndrome; CHARGE).
Omsk hemorrhagic fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by a Flavivirus.[1]
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a disease caused by infection with the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.[1] Symptoms include severe itching, bumps under the skin, and blindness.[1] It is the second most common cause of blindness due to infection, after trachoma.[2]
An oncocytoma is a tumor made up of oncocytes, epithelial cells characterized by an excessive amount of mitochondria, resulting in an abundant acidophilic, granular cytoplasm.[1][2] The cells and the tumor that they compose are often benign but sometimes may be premalignant or malignant.
Oneirophobia (from Greek όνειρο (oneiro), meaning "dream", and φόβος (phobos), meaning "fear") is the fear of dreams. It is discussed in The Dream Frontier, a book by Mark Blechner, a neuro-psychoanalyst at the William Alanson White Institute.[1]
Onychogryphosis (also known as onychogryposis or ram's horn nails)[1] is a hypertrophy that may produce nails resembling claws or a ram's horn.
Onycholysis /ˌɒnᵻˈkɒlɪsɪs/ is a common medical condition characterized by the painless detachment of the nail from the nail bed, usually starting at the tip and/or sides.[1] On the hands, it occurs particularly on the ring finger but can occur on any of the fingernails. It may also happen to toenails.
Onychomadesis is a periodic idiopathic shedding of the nails beginning at the proximal end, possibly caused by the temporary arrest of the function of the nail matrix.[1]:784[2]:660
Onychomatricoma is a cutaneous condition characterized by a distinctive tumor of the nail matrix.[1]
Onychomycosis, also known as tinea unguium, is a fungal infection of the nail.[2] This condition may affect toenails or fingernails, but toenail infections are particularly common.
Onychophosis is a localized or diffuse hyperkeratotic tissue that develops on the lateral or proximal nailfolds, within the space between the nailfolds and the nail plate, and is a common finding in the elderly.[1]:784 Onychophosis may involve the subungual area, as a direct result of repeated minor trauma, and most frequently affects the first and fifth toes.[1]:784
Opioid-induced hyperalgesia[1] or opioid-induced abnormal pain sensitivity,[2] also called paradoxical hyperalgesia[3] is a phenomenon associated with the long-term use of opioids such as morphine[citation needed], hydrocodone[citation needed], oxycodone[citation needed], and methadone.[4][5] Over time, individuals taking opioids can develop an increasing sensitivity to noxious stimuli, even evolving a painful response to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia)[citation needed]. Some studies on animals have also demonstrated this effect occurring after only a single high dose of opioids.[6]
An opportunistic infection is an infection caused by pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa) that take advantage of an opportunity not normally available, such as a host with a weakened immune system, an altered microbiota (such as a disrupted gut flora), or breached integumentary barriers. Many of these pathogens do not cause disease in a healthy host that has a normal immune system. However, a compromised immune system, a penetrating injury, or a lack of competition from normal commensals presents an opportunity for the pathogen to infect.
Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is defined by the DSM-5 as "a pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least six months".[1] Unlike children with conduct disorder (CD), children with oppositional defiant disorder are not aggressive towards people or animals, do not destroy property, and do not show a pattern of theft or deceit.[2] A diagnosis of ODD is also no longer applicable if the individual is diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD).
Opsismodysplasia is a type of skeletal dysplasia (a bone disease that interferes with bone development) first described by Zonana and associates in 1977, and designated under its current name by Maroteaux (1984). Derived from the Greek opsismos ("late"), the name "opsismodysplasia" describes a delay in bone maturation. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by micromelia (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder. It is similar to spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type.[1][2][3][4][5]
Optic disc drusen (ODD) or optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) are globules of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides that progressively calcify in the optic disc.[1][2] They are thought to be the remnants of the axonal transport system of degenerated retinal ganglion cells.[3][4][5] ODD have also been referred to as congenitally elevated or anomalous discs, pseudopapilledema, pseudoneuritis, buried disc drusen, and disc hyaline bodies.[6] They may be associated with vision loss of varying degree occasionally resulting in blindness.
Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve. It is also known as optic papillitis (when the head of the optic nerve is involved) and retrobulbar neuritis (when the posterior of the nerve is involved). It is most often associated with multiple sclerosis, and it may lead to complete or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes.
Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF or OSF) is a chronic, complex, premalignant ( 1% transformation risk ) lesion of the oral cavity, characterized by juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction and progressive fibrosis of the submucosal tissues (the lamina propria and deeper connective tissues). As the disease progresses, the jaws become rigid to the point that the person is unable to open the mouth.[1][2] The condition is remotely linked to oral cancers and is associated with areca nut or betel quid chewing, a habit similar to tobacco chewing, is practiced predominantly in Southeast Asia and India, dating back thousands of years.
Oral-facial-digital syndrome is a group of at least 13 related conditions that affect the development of the mouth, facial features, and digits in between 1 in 50,000 to 250,000 newborns with the majority of cases being type I (Papillon-League-Psaume syndrome).[1]
An organic brain syndrome (OBS), also known as an organic brain disease/disorder (OBD), an organic mental syndrome (OMS), or an organic mental disorder (OMD), is a syndrome or disorder of mental function whose cause is alleged to be known as organic (physiologic) rather than purely of the mind. These names are older and nearly obsolete general terms from psychiatry, referring to many physical disorders that cause impaired mental function.[1] They are meant to exclude psychiatric disorders (mental disorders). Originally, the term was created to distinguish physical (termed "organic") causes of mental impairment from psychiatric (termed "functional") disorders, but during the era when this distinction was drawn, not enough was known about brain science (including neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and mind-brain correlation) for this etiologic classification to be more than educated guesswork labeled with misplaced certainty, which is why it has been deemphasized in current medicine.
Organophosphate poisoning is poisoning due to organophosphates (OPs). Organophosphate are used as insecticides, medications, and nerve agents.[4] Symptoms include increased saliva and tear production, diarrhea, vomiting, small pupils, sweating, muscle tremors, and confusion.[2] While onset of symptoms is often rapid they can take up to 12 hours to appear.[1] Symptoms can last for days to weeks.[2]
Ornithine aminotransferase deficiency (also known as gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina) is an inborn error of ornithine metabolism, caused by decreased activity of the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase. Biochemically, it can be detected by elevated levels of ornithine in the blood.[1] Clinically, it presents initially with poor night vision, which slowly progresses to total blindness.[2] It is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Approximately 200 known cases have been reported in the literature. The incidence is highest in Finland, estimated at 1:50,000.[2]
Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is the development of symptoms when standing upright which are relieved when reclining.[1] There are many types of orthostatic intolerance. OI can be a subcategory of dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system[2] occurring when an individual stands up.[3]
Osgood–Schlatter disease (OSD), also known as apophysitis of the tibial tubercle, is an inflammation of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity.[2] It is characterized by a painful bump just below the knee and is most often seen in young adolescents. Risk factors include overuse (especially in sports involving running, jumping and quick changes of direction) and adolescent growth spurts.
OSLAM syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. Its name is an initialism of "osteosarcoma, limb anomalies, and erythroid macrocytosis with megaloblastic marrow syndrome". OSLAM syndrome was recognised and described by Mulvilhill et al. as a syndrome that increases susceptibility to tumours and is characterised by an impaired regulation of bone and marrow development.[1][2]
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone.[1] The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected.[2]
Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) is a joint disorder in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.[1] OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.
Osteochondritis is a painful type of osteochondrosis where the cartilage or bone in a joint is inflamed.[1]
Osteochondromas or osteocartilaginous exostoses are the most common benign tumors of the bones.[1] The tumors take the form of cartilage-capped bony projections or outgrowth on the surface of bones (exostoses).[2] It is characterized as a type of overgrowth that can occur in any bone where cartilage forms bone. Tumors most commonly affect long bones in the leg, pelvis, or scapula (shoulder blade).[3] Development of osteochondromas take place during skeletal growth between the ages of 13 and 15 and ceases when the growth plate fuses at puberty.[4] They arise within the first three decades of life affecting children and adolescents.[2][5] Osteochondromas occur in 3% of the general population and represent 35% of all benign tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. Majority of these tumors are solitary non-hereditary lesions and approximately 15% of osteochondromas occur as hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMOs).[2][5] They can occur as a solitary lesion (solitary osteochondroma) or multiple lesions within the context of the same bone (Multiple Osteochondroma).[2] Osteochondromas do not result from injury and the exact cause remains unknown. Recent research has indicated that multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line Mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease.[6] The treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements.[2][5]
Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium. The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone mineralization. Osteomalacia in children is known as rickets, and because of this, use of the term "osteomalacia" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease. Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the bones. In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions necessary for bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides) occurs in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, likely contributing locally to cause matrix hypomineralization (osteomalacia).[1][2][3][4][5]
Osteomyelitis (OM) is infection and inflammation of the bone.[1] It can be usefully subclassified on the basis of the causative organism (pyogenic bacteria or mycobacteria) and the route, duration and anatomic location of the infection. Osteomyelitis usually begins as an acute infection, but it may evolve into a chronic condition.[2] The word is from Greek words ὀστέον osteon, meaning bone, μυελό- myelo- meaning marrow, and -ῖτις -itis meaning inflammation.
Osteopoikilosis is a benign, autosomal dominant sclerosing dysplasia of bone characterized by the presence of numerous bone islands in the skeleton.[1]
Osteoporosis is a disease where decreased bone strength increases the risk of a broken bone. It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly.[3] Bones that commonly break include the back bones, the bones of the forearm, and the hip.[4] Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.[3]
Osteosclerosis is a type of osteopetrosis that involves abnormal hardening of bone[1] and an elevation in bone density.[2] It can be a pathology, normally detected on a radiograph as an area of increased opacity; that is, where more mineral is present in the bone to absorb or deflect the X-ray beam. Localized osteosclerosis can be caused by injuries that compress the bone, by osteoarthritis, and osteoma.
Otodental syndrome, also known as otodental dysplasia, is an exceptionally rare disease that is distinguished by a specific phenotype known as globodontia, that in rare cases can be associated with eye coloboma and high frequency hearing loss. Globodontia is an abnormal condition that can occur in both the primary and secondary dentition, except for the incisors which are normal in shape and size.[1][2][3] This is demonstrated by significant enlargement of the canine and molar teeth.[1] The premolars are either reduced in size or are absent.[3] In some cases, the defects affecting the teeth, eye and ear can be either individual or combined.[4] When these conditions are combined with eye coloboma, the condition is also known as oculo-otodental syndrome. The first known case of otodental syndrome was found in Hungary in a mother and her son by Denes and Csiba in 1969.[5] Prevalence is less than 1 out of every 1 million individuals.[2] The cause of otodental syndrome is considered to be genetic. It is an autosomal dominant inheritance and is variable in its expressivity.[6] Haploinsufficiency in the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene (11q13) has been reported in patients with otodental syndrome and is thought to cause the phenotype.[2] Both males and females are equally affected. Individuals diagnosed with otodental syndrome can be of any age; age is not a relevant factor. Currently there are no specific genetic treatments for otodental syndrome. Dental and orthodontic management are the recommended course of action.[1]
Otosclerosis or otospongiosis is an abnormal growth of bone near the middle ear. It can result in hearing loss.[1] The term otosclerosis is something of a misnomer. Much of the clinical course is characterised by lucent rather than sclerotic bony changes, hence it is also known as otospongiosis.
Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) is an autosomal recessive disorder of bone growth that results in skeletal abnormalities, severe hearing loss, and distinctive facial features. The name of the condition indicates that it affects hearing (oto-) and the bones of the spine (spondylo-), and enlarges the ends of bones (megaepiphyses).
Ovarian cancer is a cancer that forms in an ovary.[1] It results in abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2] When this process begins, there may be no or only vague symptoms. Symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses.[3][4] These symptoms may include bloating, pelvic pain, abdominal swelling, and loss of appetite, among others.[3] Common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen, lining of the bowel and bladder, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.[5][6]
An overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is a rare but rapidly fatal infection occurring in individuals following removal of the spleen. The infections are typically characterized by either meningitis or sepsis, and are caused by encapsulated organisms including Streptococcus pneumoniae.[1]
Pachygyria (from the Greek "pachy" meaning "thick" or "fat" gyri) is a congenital malformation of the cerebral hemisphere. It results in unusually thick convolutions of the cerebral cortex. Typically, children have developmental delay and seizures, the onset and severity depending on the severity of the cortical malformation. Infantile spasms are common in affected children, as is intractable epilepsy.
Pacman dysplasia (alternatively known as epiphyseal stippling with osteoclastic hyperplasia) is a lethal autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia. The dysplasia is present during fetal development.[1]
Paget's disease of bone (also termed osteitis deformans or ambiguously, just Paget's disease) is caused by the excessive breakdown and formation of bone, followed by disorganized bone remodeling. This causes affected bone to weaken, resulting in pain, misshapen bones, fractures and arthritis in the joints near the affected bones. Rarely, it can develop into a primary bone cancer known as Paget's sarcoma. Often Paget's disease is localized to only a few bones in the body. The pelvis, femur, and lower lumbar vertebrae are the most commonly affected bones. Paget's disease typically is localized, affecting just one or a few bones, as opposed to osteoporosis, for example, which usually affects all the bones in the body.
Paget's disease of the breast is a type of cancer that outwardly may have the appearance of eczema, with skin changes involving the nipple of the breast. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4.3% of all breast cancers and was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although actually indicative of underlying breast cancer.[2][3]
Palindromic rheumatism (PR) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis. There is acute pain, redness, swelling, and disability of one (usually) or multiple joints. The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable. Attacks may last from few hours to days. Attacks may become more frequent with time. There is no joint damage after attacks.
Pallister–Hall syndrome is a disorder that affects the development of many parts of the body.
Pallister–Killian syndrome (also tetrasomy 12p mosaicism or Pallister mosaic aneuploidy syndrome) is an extremely rare genetic disorder occurring in humans. Pallister-Killian occurs due to the presence of the anomalous extra isochromosome 12p, the short arm of the twelfth chromosome. This leads to the development of tetrasomy 12p.[1] Because not all cells have the extra isochromosome, Pallister-Killian is a mosaic condition (more readily detected in skin fibroblasts).
Panayiotopoulos syndrome is a common idiopathic childhood-related seizure disorder that occurs exclusively in otherwise normal children (idiopathic epilepsy) and manifests mainly with autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus.[1] An expert consensus has defined Panayiotopoulos syndrome as "a benign age-related focal seizure disorder occurring in early and mid-childhood. It is characterized by seizures, often prolonged, with predominantly autonomic symptoms, and by an EEG [electroencephalogram] that shows shifting and/or multiple foci, often with occipital predominance."[2]
Pancreas or Pancreatic divisum is a congenital anomaly in the anatomy of the ducts of the pancreas in which a single pancreatic duct is not formed, but rather remains as two distinct dorsal and ventral ducts.
Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body.[1] There are a number of types of pancreatic cancer. The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 85% of cases, and the term "pancreatic cancer" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas which makes digestive enzymes. Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells. One to two percent of cases of pancreatic cancer are neuroendocrine tumors, which arise from the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas. These are generally less aggressive than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[2]
Pancreatoblastoma is a rare type of pancreatic cancer.[1]
Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.[1] Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a feeling that something really bad is going to happen.[1][2] The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes.[2] There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks have occurred in the past.[1]
Panniculitis is a group of diseases whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin - panniculus adiposus).[1] Symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue.
Papilledema (or papilloedema) is optic disc swelling that is caused by increased intracranial pressure. The swelling is usually bilateral and can occur over a period of hours to weeks. Unilateral presentation is extremely rare. Papilledema is mostly seen as a symptom resulting from another pathophysiological process.
Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome (PLS), also known as palmoplantar keratoderma with periodontitis,[1][2] is an autosomal recessive[3] genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in cathepsin C.[4][5]
Papular mucinosis (also known as "Scleromyxedema,"[1][2] "Generalized lichen myxedematosus," and "Sclerodermoid lichen myxedematosus") is a rare skin disease. Localized and disseminated cases are called papular mucinosis or lichen myxedematosus while generalized, confluent papular forms with sclerosis are called scleromyxedema. Frequently, all three forms are regarded as papular mucinosis. However, some authors restrict it to only mild cases. Another form, acral persistent papular mucinosis is regarded as a separate entity.
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) (also known as "Brazilian blastomycosis,"[1] "South American blastomycosis,",[1]"Lutz-Splendore-de Almeida disease"[2] and "paracoccidioidal granuloma"[3]:320) is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sometimes called South American blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis is caused by a different fungus than that which causes blastomycosis.
A paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm that may develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen). About 97% are benign and cured by surgical removal; the remaining 3% are malignant because they are able to produce distant metastases. "Paraganglioma" is now the most-widely accepted term for these lesions, that have been also described as: glomus tumor, chemodectoma, perithelioma, fibroangioma, and sympathetic nevi.[1]
Paramyotonia congenita (PC), also known as paramyotonia congenita of von Eulenburg or Eulenburg disease,[1] is a rare congenital autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder characterized by “paradoxical” myotonia.[2] This type of myotonia has been termed paradoxical because it becomes worse with exercise whereas classical myotonia, as seen in myotonia congenita, is alleviated by exercise. PC is also distinguished as it can be induced by cold temperatures. Although more typical of the periodic paralytic disorders, patients with PC may also have potassium-provoked paralysis. PC typically presents within the first decade of life and has 100% penetrance. Patients with this disorder commonly present with myotonia in the face or upper extremities. The lower extremities are generally less affected. While some other related disorders result in muscle atrophy, this is not normally the case with PC. This disease can also present as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and there is debate as to whether the two disorders are actually distinct.[3]
Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a broad variety of tumors including lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and others. PCD is a rare condition that occurs in less than 1% of cancer patients.
Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental disorder characterized by paranoia and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others. Individuals with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily insulted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. Paranoid individuals are eager observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.[1]
Paraphilia (also known as sexual perversion and sexual deviation) is the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, fetishes, situations, fantasies, behaviors, or individuals.[1] No consensus has been found for any precise border between unusual sexual interests and paraphilic ones.[2][3] There is debate over which, if any, of the paraphilias should be listed in diagnostic manuals, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Paraplegia is an impairment in motor or sensory function of the lower extremities. The word comes from Ionic Greek: παραπληγίη "half-striking". It is usually caused by spinal cord injury or a congenital condition that affects the neural (brain) elements of the spinal canal. The area of the spinal canal that is affected in paraplegia is either the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. Common victims of this impairment are veterans or members of the armed forces. If four limbs are affected by paralysis, tetraplegia or quadriplegia is the correct term. If only one limb is affected, the correct term is monoplegia.
Parapsoriasis refers to one of a group of skin disorders that are characterized primarily by their resemblance to psoriasis (red, scaly lesions), rather than by their underlying etiology.
Parastremmatic dwarfism is a rare bone disease that features severe dwarfism, thoracic kyphosis (a type of scoliosis that affects the upper back), a distortion and twisting of the limbs, contractures of the large joints, malformations of the vertebrae and pelvis, and incontinence. The disease was first reported in 1970 by Leonard Langer and associates; they used the term parastremmatic from the Greek parastremma, or distorted limbs, to describe it. On X-rays, the disease is distinguished by a "flocky" or lace-like appearance to the bones.[1] The disease is congenital, which means it is apparent at birth. It is caused by a mutation in the TRPV4 gene, located on chromosome 12 in humans. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[1][2][3]
A parathyroid neoplasm is a tumor of the parathyroid gland.
Paratyphoid fever, also known simply as paratyphoid, is a bacterial infection caused by one of the three types of Salmonella enterica.[1] Symptoms usually begin six to thirty days after exposure and are the same as those of typhoid fever.[1][2] Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. Weakness, loss of appetite, and headaches also commonly occur.[1] Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots.[3] Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months.[1] Other people may carry the bacteria without being affected; however, are still able to spread the disease to others.[2] Both typhoid and paratyphoid are of similar severity.[2] Paratyphoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with typhoid fever.[4]
Parkes Weber Syndrome (PWS) is an uncommon congenital vascular malformation (CVM) similar to Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome, but has its own distinct conditions.[1][2] It was first described in 1907 by British dermatologist Frederick Parkes Weber.[3][2] It is only found in about 0.3% of the world population.[1]
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system.[1] The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. Early in the disease, the most obvious are shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.[1] Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur. Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in more than a third of people with PD.[2] Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems.[1][2] The main motor symptoms are collectively called "parkinsonism", or a "parkinsonian syndrome".[3][4]
Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.[1][2] Parkinsonism shares symptoms found in Parkinson's disease, from which it is named; but parkinsonism is a symptom complex, and differs from Parkinson's disease which is a progressive neurodegenerative illness. The underlying causes of parkinsonism are numerous, and diagnosis can be complex.[3][4] The neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. However, a wide range of other etiologies may lead to a similar set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic diseases, and a handful of neurological conditions other than Parkinson's.[5]
A paronychia (/ˌpærəˈnɪkiə/; Greek: παρωνυχία from para, "around" and onukh-, "nail") is a nail disease that is an often-tender bacterial or fungal infection of the hand or foot where the nail and skin meet at the side or the base of a finger or toenail. The infection can start suddenly (acute paronychia) or gradually (chronic paronychia).[1][2] Paronychia is commonly misapplied as a synonym for whitlow or felon.
Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), also known as Donath-Landsteiner syndrome, is a disease of humans that is characterized by the sudden presence of hemoglobin in the urine (called hemoglobinuria), typically after exposure to cold temperatures. It carries the name of the Austrian internists Julius Donath (1870–1950) and Karl Landsteiner (1868-1943) who described it in 1904; it was the first condition recognized as an autoimmune disease.[1]
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired,[1] life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, a part of the body's intrinsic immune system. This destructive process is a result of a defect in the formation of surface proteins on the red blood cell, which normally function to inhibit such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells throughout the circulatory system, the hemolysis is considered an intravascular hemolytic anemia. Other key features of the disease, notably the high incidence of thrombosis, are not totally understood.[2]
Paruresis (/ˌpɑːrəˈriːsɪs/ PAR-ə-REE-sis) is a type of phobia in which the sufferer is unable to urinate in the real or imaginary presence of others, such as in a public restroom. The analogous condition that affects bowel movement is called parcopresis.
Pashayan syndrome also known as Pashayan–Prozansky Syndrome, and blepharo-naso-facial syndrome is a rare syndrome. Facial abnormalities characterise this syndrome as well as malformation of extremities.[1] Specific characteristics would be a bulky, flattened nose, where the face has a mask like appearance and the ears are also malformed.[2]
Patau syndrome is a syndrome caused by a chromosomal abnormality, in which some or all of the cells of the body contain extra genetic material from chromosome 13. The extra genetic material disrupts normal development, causing multiple and complex organ defects.
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a condition wherein the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth.
Peanut allergy is a type of food allergy to peanuts. It is different from nut allergies. Physical symptoms of allergic reaction can include itchiness, urticaria, swelling, eczema, sneezing, asthma, abdominal pain, drop in blood pressure, diarrhea, and cardiac arrest.[1] Anaphylaxis may occur.[1]
T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (WHO 2008),[1]:219 previously labeled precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (WHO 2001)[1]:219 and also known as precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma is a form of lymphoid leukemia[2][3] and lymphoma[4] in which too many T-cell lymphoblasts (immature white blood cells) are found in the blood, bone marrow, and tissues, particularly mediastinal lymph nodes.[1]:635 Labeling as leukemia or lymphoma depends on which feature is more pronounced in a given situation, but has no biological or treatment implication.[1]:635
Pediculosis is an infestation of lice (blood-feeding ectoparasitic insects of the order Phthiraptera).[1][2] The condition can occur in almost any species of warm-blooded animal (i.e. mammals and birds), including humans.[1][2] Although pediculosis in humans may properly refer to lice infestation of any part of the body, the term is sometimes used loosely to refer to pediculosis capitis, the infestation of the human head with the specific head louse.
PEHO syndrome is a progressive encephalopathy with edema, hypsarrhythmia and optic atrophy. It is a very rare disease, one of the Finnish heritage diseases, and has been reported also in Dutch and Swiss infants.[1][2]
Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare central nervous system disorder in which coordination, motor abilities, and intellectual function are delayed to variable extents.[1]
Pellagra is a vitamin deficiency disease most frequently caused by a chronic lack of niacin (vitamin B3 or vitamin PP, from pellagra-preventing factor) in the diet. It can be caused by decreased intake of niacin or tryptophan,[1] and possibly by excessive intake of leucine.[2] It may also result from alterations in protein metabolism in disorders such as carcinoid syndrome or Hartnup disease. A deficiency of the amino acid lysine can lead to a deficiency of niacin, as well.[3]
Pelvic inflammatory disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis.[1][2] Often there may be no symptoms.[3] Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation.[3] Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.[2][4][5]
The rare disease pelvic lipomatosis is most often seen in older obese black men with hypertension. In pelvic lipomatosis, abnormally dense deposits of otherwise apparently normal fat may be observed in the spaces of the pelvic area. Associated with cystitis glandularis, a precursor to adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder.

Pendred syndrome or Pendred disease is a genetic disorder leading to congenital bilateral (both sides) sensorineural hearing loss and goitre with euthyroid or mild hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid gland function). There is no specific treatment, other than supportive measures for the hearing loss and thyroid hormone supplementation in case of hypothyroidism. It is named after Dr Vaughan Pendred (1869–1946), the English doctor who first described the condition in an Irish family living in Durham in 1896.[1][2] It accounts for 7.5% of all cases of congenital deafness.[3]
Pentalogy of Cantrell (or thoraco-abdominal syndrome) is a rare[1] syndrome that causes defects involving the diaphragm, abdominal wall, pericardium, heart and lower sternum.
Pentosuria is a condition where the sugar xylitol,[1] a pentose, presents in the urine in unusually high concentrations. It was characterized as an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism in 1908.[2] It is associated with a deficiency of L-xylulose reductase, necessary for xylitol metabolism.[1][3] L-Xylulose is a reducing sugar, so it may give false diagnosis of diabetes, as it is found in high concentrations in urine. However, people with pentosuria do not have nonstandard metabolism of glucose, like diabetics.[4] Patients of pentosuria have a low concentration of the sugar d-xyloketose.[5] Using, Phenyl pentosazone crystals, phloroglucin reaction, and absorption spectrum, pentose can be traced back as the reducing substance in urine, with those that have pentosuria.[6]
Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis or periodic fever aphthous pharyngitis and cervical adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome is a medical condition, typically starting in young children, in which high fever occurs periodically at intervals of about 3–5 weeks, frequently accompanied by aphthous-like ulcers, pharyngitis and/or cervical adenitis (cervical lymphadenopathy). The syndrome was described in 1987 and named two years later.[1] [2][3]
Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), previously known as nocturnal myoclonus, is a sleep disorder where the patient moves limbs involuntarily during sleep, and has symptoms or problems related to the movement.
Periodontitis, also known as pyorrhea, is a set of inflammatory diseases affecting the periodontium, i.e., the tissues that surround and support the teeth. Periodontitis involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth, and if left untreated, can lead to the loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. Periodontitis is caused by microorganisms that adhere to and grow on the tooth's surfaces, along with an over-aggressive immune response against these microorganisms. A diagnosis of periodontitis is established by inspecting the soft gum tissues around the teeth with a probe (i.e., a clinical examination) and by evaluating the patient's X-ray films (i.e., a radiographic examination), to determine the amount of bone loss around the teeth.[1] Specialists in the treatment of periodontitis are periodontists; their field is known as "periodontology" or "periodontics".
Perioral dermatitis (also called periorifical dermatitis) is skin disease characterised by multiple small (1–2 mm) papules, pustules and vesicles which are localized to the skin around the mouth, around the nostrils, or around the eyes. It most commonly affects women between the ages of 20 and 45 years, but may also affect children, men and the elderly. It is not uncommon, and has a tendency to recur in individuals who have had it once.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum. As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death. In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.[1][2][3][4][5]
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is damage to or disease affecting nerves, which may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function, or other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected. Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy), vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy, or commonly prescribed antibiotics including Metronidazole and the Fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Levaquin, Avelox etc.)), traumatic injury, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, Coeliac disease, or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause).[1][2][3] In conventional medical usage, the word neuropathy (neuro-, "nervous system" and -pathy, "disease of")[4] without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy.
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma refers to a group of T-cell lymphomas that develop away from the thymus.
Perisylvian syndrome is a rare neurological disease characterized by damage to the sylvian fissure (lateral sulcus), an area in the brain involved in language and speech. The main symptoms are difficulty chewing and swallowing, low muscle tone in the face and tongue, speech and language development disorders, and epilepsy. These symptoms may also be accompanied by difficulties with mobility and intellectual disabilities.[1]
Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs. Peritonitis may be localized or generalized, and may result from infection (often due to perforation of the intestinal tract as may occur in abdominal trauma or inflamed appendix) or from a non-infectious process.
Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a form of white-matter brain injury, characterized by the necrosis (more often coagulation) of white matter near the lateral ventricles.[1][2] It can affect newborns and (less commonly) fetuses; premature infants are at the greatest risk of the disorder. Affected individuals generally exhibit motor control problems or other developmental delays, and they often develop cerebral palsy or epilepsy later in life.
Persistent truncus arteriosus (or Patent truncus arteriosus or Common arterial trunk), is a rare form of congenital heart disease that presents at birth. In this condition, the embryological structure known as the truncus arteriosus fails to properly divide into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. This results in one arterial trunk arising from the heart and providing mixed blood to the coronary arteries, pulmonary arteries, and systemic circulation.[1]
Pertussis (also known as whooping cough or 100-day cough) is a highly contagious bacterial disease.[1][2] Initially, symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough. This is then followed by weeks of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in.[2] The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase "100-day cough".[3] A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort.[2][4] Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe.[2] The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days.[5] Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.[2]
Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (often abbreviated PJS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa (melanosis).[1] This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes[2] and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes.[3] It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.[4]
Pfeiffer syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull which affects the shape of the head and face. In addition, the syndrome includes abnormalities of the hands (such as wide and deviated thumbs) and feet (such as wide and deviated big toes). Pfeiffer syndrome affects about 1 in 100,000 births.[1]
Pharyngitis is inflammation of the back of the throat, known as the pharynx.[1] It typically results in a sore throat and fever.[1] Other symptoms may include a runny nose, cough, headache, a hoarse voice.[2] Symptoms usually last three to five days. Complications can include sinusitis and acute otitis media.[1] Pharyngitis is typically a type of respiratory tract infection.[3]
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine.[2] Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorder. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.[1]
A pheochromocytoma (from Greek phaios "dark", chroma "color", kytos "cell", -oma "tumor") or phaeochromocytoma (PCC) is a neuroendocrine tumor of the medulla of the adrenal glands (originating in the chromaffin cells), or extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue that failed to involute after birth,[1] that secretes high amounts of catecholamines, mostly norepinephrine, plus epinephrine to a lesser extent.[2] Extra-adrenal paragangliomas (often described as extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas) are closely related, though less common, tumors that originate in the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system and are named based upon the primary anatomical site of origin.
Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is a form of epilepsy in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli that form patterns in time or space, such as flashing lights, bold, regular patterns, or regular moving patterns.
Physical urticaria is a distinct subgroup of the urticaria that are induced by an exogenous physical stimulus rather than occurring spontaneously.[1] There are seven subcategories that are recognized as independent diseases.[2][3] Physical urticaria is known to be a painful, itchy and physically unappealing; which can recur for months to years of a person's life.[4]
Phytophotodermatitis, also known as "lime disease" (not to be confused with Lyme disease),[1] "Berloque dermatitis",[2] or "Margarita photodermatitis"[3][4] is a chemical reaction which makes skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light. It is frequently mistaken for hereditary conditions such as atopic dermatitis or chemical burns, but it is caused by contact with the photosensitizing compounds found naturally in some plants and vegetables like parsnips, citrus fruits and more. Symptoms include burning, itching, stinging and large blisters that slowly accumulate over time.[5]
Pica is characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as ice (pagophagia); hair (trichophagia); paper (papyrophagia); drywall or paint; metal (metallophagia); stones (lithophagia) or earth (geophagia); glass (hyalophagia); or feces (coprophagia); and chalk.[1] According to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) criteria, for these actions to be considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age where eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. It can lead to intoxication in children, which can result in an impairment in both physical and mental development.[2] In addition, it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and parasitosis.[2] Pica has been linked to other mental and emotional disorders. Stressors such as emotional trauma, maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, and a disorganized family structure are strongly linked to pica as a form of comfort.[citation needed]
Pickardt syndrome (also Pickardt's syndrome or Pickardt–Fahlbusch syndrome) denotes a rare form of tertiary hypothyroidism that is caused by interruption of the portal veins connecting hypothalamus and pituitary.
Piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of melanocyte development.[1]:867 Common characteristics include a congenital white forelock, scattered normal pigmented and hypopigmented macules and a triangular shaped depigmented patch on the forehead. There is nevertheless great variation in the degree and pattern of presentation, even within affected families. In some cases, piebaldism occurs together with severe developmental problems, as in Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease. It has been documented to occur in all races; early photographers captured many images of African piebalds used as a form of amusement, and George Catlin is believed to have painted several portraits of Native Americans of the Mandan tribe who were affected by piebaldism.[2] Piebaldism is found in nearly every species of mammal. It is very common in mice, rabbits, dogs, sheep, deer, cattle and horses—where selective breeding has increased the incidence of the mutation-, but occurs among chimpanzees and other primates only as rarely as among humans. Piebaldism is completely unrelated to acquired or infectious conditions such as vitiligo or poliosis.
Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is an affliction of the eye that can lead to a form of glaucoma known as pigmentary glaucoma. It takes place when pigment cells slough off from the back of the iris and float around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that it can begin to clog the trabecular meshwork (the major site of aqueous humour drainage), which can in turn prevent the aqueous humour from draining and therefore increases the pressure inside the eye. With PDS, the intra ocular pressure tends to spike at times and then can return to normal. Exercise has been shown to contribute to spikes in pressure as well. When the pressure is great enough to cause damage to the optic nerve, this is called pigmentary glaucoma. As with all types of glaucoma, when damage happens to the optic nerve fibers, the vision loss that occurs is irreversible and painless.
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a joint disease characterized by inflammation and overgrowth of the joint lining. It usually affects the hip or knee. It can also occur in the shoulder, ankle, elbow, hand or foot. In PVNS the lining of the joint, called the synovium, becomes swollen and grows. This growth harms the bone next to the joint. The lining also makes extra fluid that can cause swelling and make movement painful. PVNS is idiopathic, it doesn't seem to run in families or be caused by certain jobs or activities. Surgery can help but, even with treatment, PVNS comes back about half the time. If the pain remains then radiation therapy may help. In the worst cases the joint must be replaced.[1]
Pili multigemini is a malformation characterized by the presence of bifurcated or multiple divided hair matrices and papillae, giving rise to the formation of multiple hair shafts within the individual follicles.[1]:768[2]
Pili torti (also known as "Twisted hairs") is characterized by short and brittle hairs that appear flattened and twisted when viewed through a microscope.[1]:638[2]:764[3]
Pilonidal cyst, also referred to as a pilonidal abscess, pilonidal sinus or sacrococcygeal fistula, is a cyst or abscess near or on the natal cleft of the buttocks that often contains hair and skin debris.[1]
Pilotto syndrome is a rare syndrome which affects the face, heart, and back. The syndrome can cause a cleft lip and palate, scoliosis, and mental retardation. The Office of Rare Diseases and National Institutes of Health have classified this syndrome as affecting less than 200,000 people in the United States.[1]
A pinealoma is a tumor of the pineal gland, a part of the brain that produces melatonin. If a pinealoma destroys the cells of the pineal gland in a child, it can cause precocious puberty.
Pinta (also known as Azul, Carate, Empeines, Lota, Mal del Pinto and Tina) is a human skin disease endemic to Mexico, Central America, and South America caused by infection with a spirochete, Treponema pallidum carateum, which is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from the organism that causes syphilis.[1]
Pipecolic acidemia, also called hyperpipecolic acidemia or hyperpipecolatemia,[1] is a very rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is caused by a peroxisomal defect.
Pitt–Hopkins syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, a wide mouth, distinctive facial features, and intermittent hyperventilation followed by apnea.[1] It is associated with an abnormality within chromosome 18: specifically, it is caused by an insufficient expression of the TCF4 gene.[2]
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (also known as "Chronic guttate parapsoriasis," "Chronic pityriasis lichenoides," "Dermatitis psoriasiformis nodularis," "Parapsoriasis chronica," and "Parapsoriasis lichenoides chronica" "PLC") is an uncommon, idiopathic, acquired dermatosis, characterized by evolving groups of erythematous, scaly papules that may persist for months.[1]:456[2]:737
Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (also known as "acute guttate parapsoriasis", "acute parapsoriasis", "acute pityriasis lichenoides", "Mucha–Habermann disease", "parapsoriasis acuta", "parapsoriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta", and "parapsoriasis varioliformis"[1]:456[2]:736) is a disease of the immune system. It is the more severe version of pityriasis lichenoides chronica. The disease is characterized by rashes and small lesions on the skin. The disease is more common in males and usually occurs in young adulthood, although it has been seen in every age group and every race. It is possible for the disease to go into remission for short periods of time or forever.
Pityriasis rubra pilaris (also known as "Devergie's disease,"[1] "Lichen ruber acuminatus,"[1] and "Lichen ruber pilaris"[1]) refers to a group of chronic disorders characterized by reddish orange, scaling plaques and keratotic follicular papules.[2]:442 Symptoms may include reddish-orange patches (Latin: rubra) on the skin, severe flaking (Latin: pityriasis), uncomfortable itching, thickening of the skin on the feet and hands, and thickened bumps around hair follicles (Latin: pilus for hair). For some, early symptoms may also include generalized swelling of the legs, feet and other parts of the body. PRP has a varied clinical progression and a varied rate of improvement. There is no known cause or cure although stress is a common factor.[citation needed]
Placental abruption (also known as abruptio placentae) is a complication of pregnancy, wherein the placental lining has separated from the uterus of the mother prior to delivery.[1] It is the most common pathological cause of late pregnancy bleeding. In humans, it refers to the abnormal separation after 20 weeks of gestation and prior to birth. It occurs on average in 0.5%, or 1 in 200, deliveries.[1] Placental abruption is a significant contributor to maternal mortality worldwide; early and skilled medical intervention is needed to ensure a good outcome, and this is not available in many parts of the world. Treatment depends on how serious the abruption is and how far along the woman is in her pregnancy.[2]
Plague is an infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Depending on lung infection, or sanitary conditions, plague can be spread in the air, by direct contact, or very rarely by contaminated undercooked food. The symptoms of plague depend on the concentrated areas of infection in each person: bubonic plague in lymph nodes, septicemic plague in blood vessels, pneumonic plague in lungs. It is treatable if detected early. Plague is still relatively common in some remote parts of the world.
Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.[1] Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop. This includes fever, headaches, and vomiting.[1] Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.[2] Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.[1]

Pneumonic plague, a severe type of lung infection, is one of three main forms of plague, all of which are caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is more virulent and rarer than bubonic plague. The difference between the versions of plague is simply the location of the infection in the body; the bubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, the pneumonic plague is an infection of the respiratory system, and the septicemic plague is an infection in the blood stream.
Septicemic (or septicaemic) plague is one of the three main forms of plague. It is caused by Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative species of bacterium. Septicemic plague is a life-threatening infection of the blood, most commonly spread by bites from infected fleas.
A pleural effusion is excess fluid that accumulates in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space that surrounds the lungs. This excess can impair breathing by limiting the expansion of the lungs. Various kinds of pleural effusion, depending on the nature of the fluid and what caused its entry into the pleural space, are hydrothorax (serous fluid), hemothorax (blood), urinothorax (urine), chylothorax (chyle), or pyothorax (pus). A pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space, and is commonly called a "collapsed lung."
Pleurisy, also known as pleuritis, is inflammation of the membranes (pleurae) that surround the lungs and line the chest cavity. This can result in a sharp chest pain with breathing.[1] Occasionally the pain may be a constant dull ache. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, fever, or weight loss depending on the underlying cause.[6]
Plum syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder. It is characterized by retinal non-attachment, colobomata, odd facies, eyes set wide, flat face, dislocated hip, abnormal big toe, contractures of the extremities, cleft lip and mono-segmented leucocytes. There may be associated learning difficulties.[1][2]
Plummer–Vinson syndrome (PVS), also called Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome or sideropenic dysphagia, is a rare disease characterized by difficulty in swallowing, iron deficiency anemia, glossitis, cheilosis and esophageal webs.[1] Treatment with iron supplementation and mechanical widening of the esophagus generally provides an excellent outcome.
[1]Pneumoconiosis is an occupational lung disease and a restrictive lung disease caused by the inhalation of dust, often in mines and from agriculture. [2]
Pneumocystosis is an infection by Pneumocystis jirovecii that primarily occurs as a pulmonary infection AIDS patients,[1] with extrapulmonary involvement being uncommon but, if occurring in the skin, presenting most often as nodular growths in the auditory canal.[2]:442
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli.[2][3] Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause.[4]
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (i/njuːˌmɒnoʊˌʌltrəˌmaɪkrəˈskɒpɪkˌsɪlɪkoʊvɒlˌkeɪnoʊˌkɒnaɪˈoʊsᵻs/[1][2]) is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust."[3]
A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall.[3] Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one sided, chest pain and shortness of breath.[2] In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death.[3] Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax.[6] It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.[1]
POEMS syndrome (also known as Crow–Fukase syndrome, Takatsuki disease, or PEP syndrome) is a rare medical syndrome. It is defined as the combination of a plasma-cell proliferative disorder (typically myeloma), polyneuropathy, and effects on many other organ systems. It begins in middle age – the average age at onset is 50 – and affects up to twice as many men as women.[1]
Poland syndrome is a rare birth defect characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the chest muscle (pectoralis) on one side of the body, and usually also webbing of the fingers (cutaneous syndactyly) of the hand on the same side (the ipsilateral hand).[2] In most affected individuals, the missing part is the large section of the muscle that normally attaches to the upper arm on one side and the breastbone (sternum) on the other. Other abnormalities may occur on the affected side of the torso. In some cases, additional muscles in the chest wall, side, and shoulder are missing or underdeveloped.
Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. In about 0.5% of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.[1] This can occur over a few hours to few days.[1][2] The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2% to 5% of children and 15% to 30% of adults die.[1] Another 25% of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5% have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs.[1][2] These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70% of infections there are no symptoms.[1] Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.[3]
Polyarteritis nodosa, also known as panarteritis nodosa,[1] periarteritis nodosa,[1] Kussmaul disease, Kussmaul-Maier disease[2] or PAN, is a systemic vasculitis of small- or medium-sized muscular arteries, typically involving renal and visceral vessels but sparing the pulmonary circulation.[3] Polyarteritis nodosa may present in infants.[4] In polyarteritis nodosa, small aneurysms are strung like the beads of a rosary,[5] therefore making "rosary sign" an important diagnostic feature of the vasculitis.[6]
Polyarthritis is any type of arthritis that involves 5 or more joints simultaneously. It is usually associated with autoimmune conditions and may be experienced at any age and is not sex specific.
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD or PCKD, also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which abnormal cysts develop and grow in the kidneys.[1] Cystic disorders can express themselves at any point, infancy, childhood, or adulthood.[2] The disease occurs in humans and some other animals. PKD is characterized by the presence of multiple cysts (hence, "polycystic") typically in both kidneys; however, 17% of cases initially present with observable disease in one kidney, with most cases progressing to bilateral disease in adulthood.[3]
Polycythemia (or Polycythaemia, see spelling differences) vera (PV) (PCV) (also known as erythremia, primary polycythemia, Vaquez disease, Osler-Vaquez disease and polycythemia rubra vera)[1] is a neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.[1] It may also result in the overproduction of white blood cells and platelets.
Polydactyly or polydactylism (from Greek πολύς (polys), meaning "many", and δάκτυλος (daktylos), meaning "finger"),[1] also known as hyperdactyly, is a congenital physical anomaly in humans, dogs, and cats having supernumerary fingers or toes.[2]
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, often abbreviated PLGA, is a rare, asymptomatic, slow-growing malignant salivary gland tumor.[1] It is most commonly found in the palate.[2]
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a syndrome with pain or stiffness, usually in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, and hips, but which may occur all over the body. The pain can be very sudden, or can occur gradually over a period. Most people with PMR wake up in the morning with pain in their muscles; however, cases have occurred in which the person has developed the pain during the evenings or has pain and stiffness all day long.[1] People who have polymyalgia rheumatica may also have temporal arteritis, an inflammation of blood vessels in the face which can cause blindness if not treated quickly.[2] The pain and stiffness can result in a lowered quality of life, and can lead to depression.
Polymyositis (PM) is a type of chronic inflammation of the muscles (inflammatory myopathy) related to dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis. Its name means "inflammation of many muscles" (poly- + myos- + -itis). The inflammation is predominantly of the endomysium in polymyositis, whereas dermatomyositis is characterized by primarily perimysial inflammation.[1]
Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS) is an inherited condition affecting the face, limbs, and genitalia.[1] The syndrome goes by a number of names including the popliteal web syndrome and, more inclusively, the facio-genito-popliteal syndrome. The term PPS was coined by Gorlin et al.. in 1968 on the basis of the most unusual anomaly, the popliteal pterygium (a web behind the knee).[2]

Porencephaly is an extremely rare cephalic disorder involving encephalomalacia.[1] It is a neurological disorder of the central nervous system characterized by cysts or cavities within the cerebral hemisphere.[2] Porencephaly was termed by Heschl in 1859 to describe a cavity in the human brain.[3] The cysts and cavities are usually the result of destructive or cystic brain lesions but can also be from abnormal development, direct damage, inflammation, or hemorrhage.[4] The cysts and cavities cause a wide range of physiological, physical, and neurological symptoms.[5] Depending on the patient, this disorder may cause only minor neurological problems, without any disruption on intelligence, while others may be severely disabled or face death before the second decade of their lives. However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur in both before or after birth.[2]
Porphyria is a group of diseases in which substances called porphyrins build up, affecting the skin or nervous system. The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria.[1] Symptoms of acute porphyria include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, and seizures.[1][2] These symptoms typically come and go with attacks that last for days to weeks. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.[2]
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common subtype of porphyria.[1] The disease is named because it is a porphyria that often presents with skin manifestations later in life. The disorder results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the fifth step in heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs. It is a component of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.
Portal hypertension is hypertension (high blood pressure) in the hepatic portal system, which are the portal vein and its branches, which drain from most of the intestines to the liver. Portal hypertension is defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient equal to or greater than 6 mmHg.[1] Cirrhosis (a form of chronic liver failure) is the most common cause of portal hypertension; other, less frequent causes are therefore grouped as non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. When it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms or complications, treatment may be given to decrease portal hypertension itself or to manage its complications.[citation needed]
Portal vein thrombosis, previously known as Cauchois–Eppinger–Frugoni syndrome,[1] is a form of venous thrombosis affecting the hepatic portal vein, which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction in the blood supply to the liver.
Post-polio syndrome (PPS, or post-poliomyelitis syndrome or post-polio sequelae) is a condition that affects approximately 25–40% of people who have previously survived an acute attack of poliomyelitis —a viral infection of the nervous system—after the initial infection. Typically the symptoms appear 15–30 years after recovery from the original paralytic attack, at an age of 35 to 60. Symptoms include acute or increased muscular weakness, pain in the muscles, and fatigue. The same symptoms may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio (NPP) infection.
Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the pigmented layer that lies between the inner retina and the outer fibrous layer composed of the sclera and cornea. The uvea consists of the middle layer of pigmented vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis is an ophthalmic emergency and requires a thorough examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist and urgent treatment to control the inflammation.
Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a form of epilepsy that results from brain damage caused by physical trauma to the brain (traumatic brain injury, abbreviated TBI). A person with PTE suffers repeated post-traumatic seizures (PTS, seizures that result from TBI) more than a week after the initial injury.[1] PTE is estimated to constitute 5% of all cases of epilepsy and over 20% of cases of symptomatic epilepsy[2][3] (in which seizures are caused by an identifiable organic brain condition).[4]
Hypokalemia, also spelled hypokalaemia, is a low level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum.[1] Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels below 3.5 mmol/L defined as hypokalemia.[1][2] Mildly low levels do not typically cause symptoms.[3] Symptoms may include feeling tired, leg cramps, weakness, and constipation.[1] It increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm such as bradycardia and cardiac arrest.[1][3]
Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder due to loss of function of specific genes.[3] In newborns symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. In childhood the person becomes constantly hungry which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. There is also typically mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems. Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height short, skin light in color, and they are unable to have children.[3]
In medicine, precocious puberty is puberty occurring at an unusually early age. In most cases, the process is normal in every aspect except the unusually early age, and simply represents a variation of normal development. In a minority of children, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a tumor or injury of the brain.[1] Even when there is no disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development, can reduce adult height potential, and may shift some lifelong health risks. Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing the pituitary hormones that induce sex steroid production. The opposite condition is delayed puberty.
Premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), or primary ovarian insufficiency is the loss of function of the ovaries before age 40.[2] A commonly cited triad for the diagnosis is amenorrhea, hypergonadotropism, and hypoestrogenism. If it has a genetic cause, it may be called gonadal dysgenesis[3]
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe and disabling form of premenstrual syndrome affecting 3–8% of menstruating women.[3] The disorder consists of a "cluster of affective, behavioral and somatic symptoms" that recur monthly during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.[3] PMDD was added to the list of depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013. The exact pathogenesis of the disorder is still unclear and is an active research topic. Treatment of PMDD relies largely on antidepressants that modulate serotonin levels in the brain via serotonin reuptake inhibitors as well as ovulation suppression using contraception.[4]
Presbycusis (also spelled presbyacusis, from Greek presbys “old” + akousis “hearing”[1]), or age-related hearing loss, is the cumulative effect of aging on hearing. It is a progressive and irreversible bilateral symmetrical age-related sensorineural hearing loss resulting from degeneration of the cochlea or associated structures of the inner ear or auditory nerves. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging (nosocusis and sociocusis) is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of multiple causes of hearing loss can be difficult.
Presbyopia is a condition associated with aging of the eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects. Symptoms include a hard time reading small print, having to hold reading material farther away, headaches, and eyestrain. Different people will have different degrees of problems. Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia.[1]
Primary aldosteronism, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism or Conn's syndrome, is excess production of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal glands resulting in low renin levels. Often it produces few symptoms.[1] Most people have high blood pressure which may cause poor vision or headaches.[1][2] Occasionally there may be muscular weakness, muscle spasms, tingling sensations, or excessive urination.[1] Complications include cardiovascular disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and abnormal heart rhythms.[3][4]
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also immotile ciliary syndrome or Kartagener syndrome, is a rare, ciliopathic, autosomal recessive genetic disorder that causes defects in the action of cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear) and fallopian tube, as well as in the flagella of sperm cells. The phrase "immotile ciliary syndrome" is no longer favored as the cilia do have movement, but may be inefficient or unsynchronized.
Primary cutaneous amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis associated with oncostatin M receptor.[1][2] This type of amyloidosis has been divided into the following types:[3]:520
Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare, inherited condition, resulting in increased excretion of oxalate, with oxalate stones being common. Hyperoxaluria refers to oxalate derived from dietary sources or that which is secondary to malabsorption. Primary hyperoxaluria, on the other hand, refers to a specific type of hyperoxaluria that is due to a metabolic defect resulting from a heritable genetic defect.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a tumor within the parathyroid gland. The symptoms of the condition relate to the elevated calcium levels, which can cause digestive symptoms, kidney stones, psychiatric abnormalities, and bone disease.
Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness in the voluntary muscles. PLS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases. Motor neuron diseases develop when the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement degenerate and die, causing weakness in the muscles they control.
Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a type of neurological syndrome in which language capabilities slowly and progressively become impaired. Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact,[1] it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss of executive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.-Marsel Mesulam in 1982.[2] Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum of disorders and Alzheimer's disease.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a disease of the bile ducts that causes inflammation and obliterative fibrosis of bile ducts inside and/or outside of the liver. This pathological process impedes the flow of bile to the intestines and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, and other complications, including bile duct and liver cancer. The underlying cause of the inflammation remains unknown, but elements of autoimmunity and microbial dysbiosis have been described[1] and are suggested by the observation that approximately 75% of individuals with PSC also have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most often ulcerative colitis.[2] The most definitive treatment for PSC is liver transplantation, though only a fraction of individuals with PSC will ultimately require it.
Sensory processing disorder (SPD; also known as sensory integration dysfunction) is a condition that exists when multisensory integration is not adequately processed in order to provide appropriate responses to the demands of the environment.
Procrastination is the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished.[1] It is the practice of doing more pleasurable things in place of less pleasurable ones, or carrying out less urgent tasks instead of more urgent ones, thus putting off impending tasks to a later time. Sometimes, procrastination takes place until the "last minute" before a deadline. Procrastination can take hold on any aspect of life — putting off cleaning the stove, repairing a leaky roof, seeing a doctor or dentist, submitting a job report or academic assignment or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Procrastination can lead to feelings of guilt, inadequacy, depression and self-doubt.
Proctitis is an inflammation of the anus and the lining of the rectum, affecting only the last 6 inches of the rectum.
Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at a very early age.[5] Progeria is one of several progeroid syndromes.[6] The word progeria comes from the Greek words "pro" (πρό), meaning "before" or "premature", and "gēras" (γῆρας), meaning "old age".[7] The disorder has a very low incidence rate, live births.[8] Those born with progeria typically live to their mid teens to early twenties.[9][10] It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation, and is rarely inherited, as carriers usually do not live to reproduce. Although the term progeria applies strictly speaking to all diseases characterized by premature aging symptoms, and is often used as such, it is often applied specifically in reference to Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and usually fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage (-pathy) or inflammation of the white matter (leuko-) of the brain (-encephalo-) at multiple locations (multifocal). It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system. JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems. In general, PML has a mortality rate of 30–50 percent in the first few months and those who survive can be left with varying degrees of neurological disabilities.
Progressive osseous heteroplasia is a cutaneous condition characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous ossification.[1]
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; or the Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, after the doctors who described it in 1963) is a degenerative disease involving the gradual deterioration and death of specific volumes of the brain.[1][2] Males and females are affected approximately equally and there is no racial, geographical or occupational predilection. Approximately 6 people per 100,000 population have PSP. It has been described as a tauopathy.[3]
Proliferating trichilemmal cysts (also known as a "Pilar tumor", "Proliferating follicular cystic neoplasm", "Proliferating pilar tumor", and "Proliferating trichilemmal tumor"[1]) are a cutaneous condition characterized by proliferations of squamous cells forming scroll-like structures.[1][2]:678
Prolidase deficiency (PD) is an extremely uncommon autosomal recessive disorder associated with collagen metabolism[1] that affects connective tissues and thus a diverse array of organ systems more broadly, though it is extremely inconsistent in its expression.
Prolymphocytic leukemia is divided into two types according to the kind of cell involved: B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. It is usually classified as a kind of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Properdin deficiency is a rare X-linked disease in which properdin, an important complement factor, is deficient.[1] Affected individuals are susceptible to fulminant meningococcal disease.
Prosopamnesia (Greek: προσωπον = "face", αμνησια = forgetfulness) is a selective neurological impairment in the ability to learn new faces. There is a special neural circuit for the processing of faces as opposed to other non-face objects. Prosopamnesia is a deficit in the part of this circuit responsible for encoding perceptions as memories.
Prostatitis (less commonly prostatosis) is inflammation of the prostate gland. Prostatitis is classified into acute, chronic, asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, and chronic pelvic pain syndrome.
Protein C deficiency is a rare genetic trait that predisposes to thrombotic disease. It was first described in 1981.[1] The disease belongs to a group of genetic disorders known as thrombophilias. Protein C deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (relative risk 8–10), whereas no association with arterial thrombotic disease has been found.[2]
Protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) or protein–calorie malnutrition refers to a form of malnutrition where there is inadequate calorie or protein intake.
Protein S deficiency is a disorder associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis.[1]Protein S, a vitamin K-dependent physiological anticoagulant, acts as a nonenzymatic cofactor to activate protein C in the degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa.[2] Decreased (antigen) levels or impaired function of protein S leads to decreased degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa and an increased propensity to venous thrombosis. Protein S circulates in human plasma in two forms: approximately 60 percent is bound to complement component C4b β-chain while the remaining 40 percent is free, only free protein S has activated protein C cofactor activity[medical citation needed]
Proteus syndrome, also known as Wiedemann syndrome (named after the German pediatrician Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann), is a rare congenital disorder[1] that causes skin overgrowth and atypical bone development, often accompanied by tumors over half the body.[2]:776
Prune belly syndrome, also referred to as abdominal muscle deficiency syndrome, congenital absence of the abdominal muscles, Eagle-Barrett syndrome,[1] Obrinsky syndrome,[2] Fröhlich syndrome,[3] or, rarely, triad syndrome, is a rare, genetic birth defect affecting about 1 in 40,000 births.[4] About 97% of those affected are male. Prune belly syndrome is a congenital disorder of the urinary system, characterized by a triad of symptoms. The syndrome is named for the mass of wrinkled skin that is often (but not always) present on the abdomen of those with the disorder.
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a skin disease characterised by pruritic (itchy) nodules which usually appear on the arms or legs. Patients often present with multiple excoriated lesions caused by scratching. PN is also known as Hyde prurigo nodularis, Picker's nodules, atypical nodular form of neurodermatitis circumscripta, lichen corneus obtusus.
Pseudoachondroplasia is a type of short-limb dwarfism. It is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder. It is generally not discovered until 2-3 years of age, since growth is normal at first. Pseudoachondroplasia is usually first detected by a delay in crawling, walking, or a curious, waddling gait.
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is an inherited blood plasma enzyme abnormality in which the body's production of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE; pseudocholinesterase) is impaired. People who have this abnormality may be sensitive to certain anesthetic drugs, including the muscle relaxants succinylcholine and mivacurium as well as other ester local anesthetics.[1]
Pseudohermaphroditism, or pseudo-hermaphroditism, is the condition in which an organism is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics[1][2] that are different from what would be expected on the basis of the gonadal tissue (ovary or testis).
Pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) is a condition that mimics hypoaldosteronism.[1] However, the condition is due to a failure of response to aldosterone, and levels of aldosterone are actually elevated, due to a lack of feedback inhibition.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a condition associated primarily with resistance to the parathyroid hormone.[1] Those with the condition have a low serum calcium and high phosphate, but the parathyroid hormone level (PTH) is actually appropriately high (due to the low level of calcium in the blood). Its pathogenesis has been linked to dysfunctional G Proteins (in particular, Gs alpha subunit). The condition is extremely rare, with an estimated overall prevalence of 7.2/1,000,000 or approximately 1/140000.
Pseudomonas infection refers to a disease caused by one of the species of the genus Pseudomonas.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical condition caused by cancerous cells (mucinous adenocarcinoma) that produce abundant mucin or gelatinous ascites.[1] The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity. This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs. Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic,[2] but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death by cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications.
Optic disc drusen (ODD) or optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) are globules of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides that progressively calcify in the optic disc.[1][2] They are thought to be the remnants of the axonal transport system of degenerated retinal ganglion cells.[3][4][5] ODD have also been referred to as congenitally elevated or anomalous discs, pseudopapilledema, pseudoneuritis, buried disc drusen, and disc hyaline bodies.[6] They may be associated with vision loss of varying degree occasionally resulting in blindness.
Pseudopelade of Brocq (also known as "Alopecia cicatrisata") is a flesh- to pink-colored, irregularly shaped alopecia that may begin in a moth-eaten pattern with eventual coalescence into larger patches of alopecia.[1]:648[2]:761
Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias (PPSH) refers to a configuration of the external genitalia of an infant. In a sense, this configuration is roughly midway between normal male genitalia and normal female genitalia in structure and appearance. It is a relatively common form of genital ambiguity caused by undervirilization of genetic males due to several different intersex conditions.

Psittacosis — also known as parrot fever, and ornithosis — is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Chlamydophila psittaci and contracted from infected parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels and budgerigars, and pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird. The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds.
Psoriasis is a long-lasting autoimmune disease which is characterized by patches of abnormal skin.[3] These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. They may vary in severity from small and localized to complete body coverage.[4] Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.[5]
Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.[1] Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness.[1] Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.[1][2] In some types other organs are also affected.[3] Onset can be gradual or sudden.[4]

Psychosis is an abnormal condition of the mind that involves a "loss of contact with reality". People experiencing psychosis may exhibit personality changes and thought disorder. Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with social interaction and impairment in carrying out daily life activities.
Pterygium refers to any winglike triangular membrane occurring in the neck, eyes, knees, elbows, ankles or digits.[1]
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (abbreviated PAP), is a rare lung disease in which abnormal accumulation of pulmonary surfactant occurs within the alveoli, interfering with gas exchange. PAP can occur in a primary form or secondarily in the settings of malignancy (especially in myeloid leukemia), pulmonary infection, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals. Rare familial forms have also been recognized, suggesting a genetic component in some cases.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term poor airflow. The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production. COPD typically worsens over time.[1] Eventually walking up stairs or carrying things becomes difficult.[2] Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD.[2][3] The term "chronic bronchitis" is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.[4]
Pulmonary hypertension (PH or PHTN) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries, together known as the lung vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, leg swelling and other symptoms.[1] Pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance. It was first identified by Ernst von Romberg in 1891.[2] According to the most recent classification, it can be one of six different types.[3]
A pulmonary sequestration (bronchopulmonary sequestration or cystic lung lesion), is a medical condition wherein a piece of tissue that ultimately develops into lung tissue is not attached to the pulmonary arterial blood supply, as is the case in normally developing lung. As a result, this sequestered tissue is not connected to the normal bronchial airway architecture, and as a result, fails to function in, and contribute to, respiration of the organism.

Pulmonic stenosis, also known as pulmonary stenosis, is a dynamic or fixed obstruction of flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood.
Café au lait spots or café au lait macules are flat, pigmented birthmarks.[1] The name café au lait is French for "coffee with milk" and refers to their light-brown color. They are also called "giraffe spots" or "coast of Maine spots".[2]
Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) or erythroblastopenia refers to a type of anemia affecting the precursors to red blood cells but not to white blood cells. In PRCA, the bone marrow ceases to produce red blood cells. The condition has been first described by Paul Kaznelson in 1922.[1]
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, often called PNP-deficiency, is a rare autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder which results in immunodeficiency.
Purpura is a condition of red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin usually secondary to vasculitis or dietary deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy).[1] They measure 0.3–1 cm (3–10 mm), whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm.[2]
Pyaemia (or pyemia) is a type of septicaemia that leads to widespread abscesses of a metastatic nature. It is usually caused by the staphylococcus bacteria by pus-forming organisms in the blood. Apart from the distinctive abscesses, pyaemia exhibits the same symptoms as other forms of septicaemia. It was almost universally fatal before the introduction of antibiotics.
Pycnodysostosis (from Greek: πυκνός (puknos) meaning "dense",[1] dys ("defective"), and ostosis ("condition of the bone")), is a lysosomal storage disease of the bone caused by a mutation in the gene that codes the enzyme cathepsin K.[2]

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a condition that causes tissue to become necrotic, causing deep ulcers that usually occur on the legs. When they occur, they can lead to chronic wounds. Ulcers usually initially look like small bug bites or papules, and they progress to larger ulcers. Though the wounds rarely lead to death, they can cause pain and scarring.
Pyomyositis, also known as tropical pyomyositis or myositis tropicans, is a bacterial infection of the skeletal muscles which results in a pus-filled abscess. Pyomyositis is most common in tropical areas but can also occur in temperate zones.
Pyrophobia is an irrational fear of fire, beyond what is considered normal. This phobia is ancient and primordial, perhaps since mankind's discovery of fire.[1]
Heartburn, also known as acid indigestion,[2] is a burning sensation in the central chest or upper central abdomen.[3][4][5] The pain often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the jaw.
Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes lactic acid and other potentially toxic compounds to accumulate in the blood. High levels of these substances can damage the body's organs and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency is a rare condition, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 250,000 births worldwide. This disorder appears to be much more common in some Algonkian Indian tribes in eastern Canada.[citation needed]
Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (also known as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency or PDCD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. PDCD is an X-linked disease that shows heterogeneous characteristics in both clinical presentation and biochemical abnormality.[1] The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a multi-enzyme complex that plays a vital role as a key regulatory step in the central pathways of energy metabolism in the mitochondria.[citation needed]
Pyruvate kinase deficiency, also called erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency,[1] is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme pyruvate kinase which affects the survival of red blood cells.[2][3] Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been observed with the disorder; classically, and more commonly, the inheritance is autosomal recessive. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the second most common cause of enzyme-deficient hemolytic anemia, following G6PD deficiency.[4]
Q fever is a disease caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii,[1] a bacterium that affects humans and other animals. This organism is uncommon, but may be found in cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small-cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick-borne.[2] The incubation period is 9–40 days. Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms.[3] The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.
Qazi–Markouizos syndrome is a rare hereditary condition characterized by non-progressive, congenital hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, an increased proportion of type 2 muscle fibers, which additionally exhibited increased size, as well as dysharmonic skeletal maturation.[1][2] To date, the molecular etiology of Qazi–Markouizos syndrome, which is also known as Puerto Rican infant hypotonia syndrome,[3] remains unknown.
Quadrantanopia, quadrantanopsia, or quadrant anopia refers to an anopia affecting a quarter of the field of vision.
A quadriceps tendon rupture is a tear of the tendon of the major leg extensor (rectus femoris), usually close to its insertion at the superior pole of the patella.
Paresis is a condition typified by a weakness of voluntary movement, or partial loss of voluntary movement or by impaired movement. When used without qualifiers, it usually refers to the limbs, but it can also be used to describe the muscles of the eyes (ophthalmoparesis), the stomach (gastroparesis), and also the vocal cords (Vocal cord paresis). Neurologists use the term paresis to describe weakness, and plegia to describe paralysis in which all voluntary movement is lost. The term paresis comes from the Ancient Greek: πάρεσις "letting go" or "paralysis" from παρίημι "to let go, to let fall".
Quebec Platelet Disorder (QPD) is a rare, autosomal dominant bleeding disorder described in a family from the province of Quebec in Canada.[1][2]
Queensland tick typhus[1] (or Australian tick typhus or (Rickettsial) spotted fever[2]) is a condition caused by a bacterium Rickettsia australis.[3]
Folliculitis decalvans is an inflammation of the hair follicle that leads to bogginess or induration of involved parts of the scalp along with pustules, erosions, crusts, and scale.[1]:649[2]:760-1 It begins at a central point and spreads outward, leaving scarring, sores, and, due to the inflammation, hair loss in its wake.[3] No permanent cure has been found for this condition. But there is promise in a regimen of dual therapy with Rifampin 300 mg twice daily and Clindamycin 300 mg twice daily. This new treatment can be used to control the condition, and tests have indicated that after 3 to 5 months long uninterrupted courses of treatment, many patients have seen limited to no recurrence.[4]
Peritonsillar abscess (PTA), also known as a quinsy, is a recognized complication of tonsillitis and consists of a collection of pus beside the tonsil in what is referred to as peritonsillar space (peri—meaning surrounding). It is a commonly encountered otorhinolaryngological (ENT) emergency.[1] 
Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals.[1] Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure.[1] These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness.[1] Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death.[1] The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year.[1] The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system.[2]
Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance. The disorder is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Symptoms include growth abnormalities of the head, face and nails, along with the development of acanthosis nigricans. Treatment involves controlling blood glucose levels by using insulin and incorporating a strategically planned, controlled diet. Also, direct actions against other symptoms may be taken (e.g. surgery for facial abnormalities) This syndrome usually affects children and has a prognosis of 1–2 years.
Radiophobia is an abnormal fear of ionizing radiation, in particular, fear of X-rays. While such radiation may be harmful given sufficient exposure (i.e. radiation-induced cancer, and acute radiation syndrome) poor information or understanding,[1][2][3] but also as a consequence of traumatic experience, may cause unnecessary or even irrational fear. The term is also used in a non-medical sense to describe the opposition to the use of nuclear technology (i.e. nuclear power) arising from concerns disproportionately greater than actual risks would merit.
Raine syndrome (RNS), also called osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial anomalies including microcephaly, noticeably low set ears, osteosclerosis, a cleft palate, gum hyperplasia, a hypoplastic nose, and eye proptosis. It is considered to be a lethal disease, and usually leads to death within a few hours of birth. However, a recent report describes two studies in which children with Raine Syndrome have lived to 8 and 11 years old, so it is currently proposed that there is a milder expression that the phenotype can take (Simpson 2009).
Ramos-Arroyo syndrome is marked by corneal anesthesia, absence of the peripapillary choriocapillaris and retinal pigment epithelium, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, unusual facial appearance, persistent ductus arteriosus, Hirschsprung disease, and moderate intellectual disability.[1] It appears to be a distinct autosomal dominant syndrome with variable expressivity.[2]
Rapadilino syndrome is an autosomal recessive[1] congenital disorder characterized by radial and patellar aplasia, short stature, arched or cleft palate, limb malformation, and dislocated joints.[1] It is more prevalent in Finland than elsewhere in the world.
Rapp–Hodgkin syndrome was formerly thought to be a unique autosomal dominant disorder due to a P63 gene mutation. However, it was recently shown to the same disease as Hay-Wells syndrome. [1]
Rapunzel syndrome is an extremely rare intestinal condition in humans resulting from ingesting hair (trichophagia).[1][2] The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Trichophagia is sometimes associated with the hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania.[3]
Rasmussen's encephalitis, also known as chronic focal encephalitis (CFE), is a rare inflammatory neurological disease, characterized by frequent and severe seizures, loss of motor skills and speech, hemiparesis (paralysis on one side of the body), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and dementia. The illness affects a single cerebral hemisphere and generally occurs in children under the age of 15.
Reactive airway disease is a group of conditions that include reversible airway narrowing due to an external stimulation.[1] These conditions generally result in wheezing.[2]
Reactive arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis[1] that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease.[2] By the time the patient presents with symptoms, often the "trigger" infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases, thus making determination of the initial cause difficult.
Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children.[1][2] RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts. It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the "inhibited form"—or can present itself as indiscriminate sociability, such as excessive familiarity with relative strangers—known as the "disinhibited form". The term is used in both the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10)[3] and in the DSM-IV-TR, the revised fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).[4] In ICD-10, the inhibited form is called RAD, and the disinhibited form is called "disinhibited attachment disorder", or "DAD". In the DSM, both forms are called RAD; for ease of reference, this article will follow that convention and refer to both forms as reactive attachment disorder.
Reactive hypoglycemia, or postprandial hypoglycemia, is a medical term describing recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurring within 4 hours[1] after a high carbohydrate meal in people who do not have diabetes.[2] It is thought to represent a consequence of excessive insulin release triggered by the carbohydrate meal but continuing past the digestion and disposal of the glucose derived from the meal.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as acid reflux, is a long term condition where stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications.[4][5] Symptoms include the taste of acid in the back of the mouth, heartburn, bad breath, chest pain, vomiting, breathing problems, and wearing away of the teeth. Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.[4]
Refsum disease, also known as classic or adult Refsum disease, heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis, phytanic acid oxidase deficiency and phytanic acid storage disease,[1][2][3][4] is an autosomal recessive[5] neurological disease that results from the over-accumulation of phytanic acid in cells and tissues. It is one of several disorders named after Norwegian neurologist Sigvald Bernhard Refsum (1907–1991).[6][7] Refsum disease typically is adolescent onset and is diagnosed by above average levels of phytanic acid. Humans obtain the necessary phytanic acid primarily through diet. It is still unclear what function phytanic acid plays physiologically in humans, but has been found to regulate fatty acid metabolism in the liver of mice.[8]
Renal agenesis is a medical condition in which one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) fetal kidneys fail to develop.
Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one of the renal arteries, most often caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. This narrowing of the renal artery can impede blood flow to the target kidney, resulting in renovascular hypertension – a secondary type of high blood pressure. Possible complications of renal artery stenosis are chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease.[1]
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport waste molecules from the blood to the urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90–95% of cases.[1]

Renal glycosuria, also known as renal glucosuria, is a rare condition in which the simple sugar glucose is excreted in the urine[1] despite normal or low blood glucose levels. With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood. However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally elevated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of nephrons, the filtering units of the kidneys.
Renovascular hypertension (or "renal hypertension") is a condition in which high blood pressure is caused by the kidneys' hormonal response to narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys.[1] When functioning properly this hormonal axis regulates blood pressure. Due to low local blood flow, the kidneys mistakenly increases blood pressure of the entire circulatory system. It is a form of secondary hypertension - a form of hypertension whose cause is identifiable.[2][3]
Renal osteodystrophy is currently defined as an alteration of bone morphology in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).[1] It is one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).[1][2][3] The term "renal osteodystrophy" was coined in 1943,[4] 60 years after an association was identified between bone disease and renal failure.[5] The traditional types of renal osteodystrophy[6] have been defined on the basis of turnover and mineralization as follows: mild, slight increase in turnover and normal mineralization; osteitis fibrosa, increased turnover and normal mineralization; osteomalacia, decreased turnover and abnormal mineralization; adynamic, decreased turnover and acellularity; mixed, increased turnover with abnormal mineralization.[1] A Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes report has suggested that bone biopsies in patients with CKD should be characterized by determining bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system).[2] On the other hand, CKD-MBD is defined as a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either one or a combination of the following: 1) abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength (renal osteodystrophy); and 3) vascular or other soft-tissue calcification.[1][7]

Reperfusion (reoxygenation) injury is the tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen (anoxia, hypoxia). The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than restoration of normal function.
A repetitive strain injury (RSI) is an "injury to the musculoskeletal and nervous systems that may be caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained or awkward positions."[1] RSIs are also known as cumulative trauma disorders, repetitive stress injuries, repetitive motion injuries or disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and occupational or sports overuse syndromes. 
Respiratory acidosis is a medical emergency in which decreased ventilation (hypoventilation) increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood and decreases the blood's pH (a condition generally called acidosis).
Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), also called neonatal respiratory distress syndrome,[1] respiratory distress syndrome of newborn, or increasingly surfactant deficiency disorder (SDD),[2] and previously called hyaline membrane disease (HMD), is a syndrome in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also be a consequence of neonatal infection.[3][4] It can also result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant associated proteins. IRDS affects about 1% of newborn infants and is the leading cause of death in preterm infants.[5] The incidence decreases with advancing gestational age, from about 50% in babies born at 26–28 weeks, to about 25% at 30–31 weeks. The syndrome is more frequent in infants of diabetic mothers and in the second born of premature twins.
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move one's legs.[2] There is often an unpleasant feeling in the legs that improves somewhat with moving them. Occasionally the arms may also be affected. The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can make it hard to sleep. Due to the disturbance in sleep people with RLS may have daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood.[2] Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep.[3]
Retinopathy is persistent or acute damage to the retina of the eye. Ongoing inflammation and vascular remodeling may occur over periods of time where the patient is not fully aware of the extent of the disease. Frequently, retinopathy is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease as seen in diabetes or hypertension.[1] Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-aged people.[2]
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment[1] due to the progressive degeneration of the rod photoreceptor cells in the retina. This form of retinal dystrophy manifests initial symptoms independent of age; thus, RP diagnosis occurs anywhere from early infancy to late adulthood.[2] Patients in the early stages of RP first notice compromised peripheral and dim light vision due to the decline of the rod photoreceptors.[3] The progressive rod degeneration is later followed by abnormalities in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the deterioration of cone photoreceptor cells. As peripheral vision becomes increasingly compromised, patients experience progressive "tunnel vision" and eventual blindness.[4] Affected individuals may additionally experience defective light-dark adaptations, nyctalopia (night blindness), and the accumulation of bone spicules in the fundus.
Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common malignant cancer of the eye in children, and it is almost exclusively found in young children.[1]
Retinoschisis is an eye disease characterized by the abnormal splitting of the retina's neurosensory layers, usually in the outer plexiform layer. Most common forms are asymptomatic, some rarer forms result in a loss of vision in the corresponding visual field.[1]
Retrograde amnesia (RA) is a loss of memory-access to events that occurred, or information that was learned, before an injury or the onset of a disease.[1] It tends to negatively affect episodic, autobiographical, and declarative memory while usually keeping procedural memory intact with no difficulty for learning new knowledge. RA can be temporally graded or more permanent based on the severity of its cause and is usually consistent with Ribot's Law: where subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more remote memories.[2] The type of information that is forgotten can be very specific, like a single event, or more general, resembling generic amnesia. It is not to be confused with anterograde amnesia, which deals with the inability to form new memories following the onset of an injury or disease.
Retroperitoneal fibrosis or Ormond's disease is a disease featuring the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum, the compartment of the body containing the kidneys, aorta, renal tract, and various other structures. It may present with lower back pain, kidney failure, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, and other obstructive symptoms. It is named after John Kelso Ormond, who rediscovered the condition in 1948.[1][2][3]
Rett syndrome (RTT), originally termed cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia,[1] is a rare genetic postnatal neurological disorder of the grey matter of the brain[2] that almost exclusively affects females but has also been found in male patients. The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth (including microcephaly in some). Repetitive stereotyped hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted.[3]
Revesz syndrome is a fatal disease that causes exudative retinopathy and bone marrow failure.[1] Other symptoms include severe aplastic anemia, intrauterine growth retardation, fine sparse hair, fine reticulate skin pigmentation,[2] ataxia due to cerebellar hypoplasia, and cerebral calcifications. Its effects are similar to that of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome.[3] It is a variant of dyskeratosis congenita.[4]
Reynolds syndrome is a rare secondary laminopathy, consisting of the combination of primary biliary cirrhosis and progressive systemic sclerosis. In some patients this syndrome has also been associated with Sjögren's syndrome and hemolytic anemia. Typical clinical features include jaundice, elevated blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcinosis cutis, telangiectasias, and pruritus. This disease may cause white or yellow-ish spots on the arms or legs. The syndrome, a special case of scleroderma, is named after the American physician, Telfer B. Reynolds, MD (1921–2004), who first described it. He is also known for creating one of the world's first hepatology programs at the University of Southern California.
Rh disease (also known as rhesus isoimmunisation, Rh (D) disease, rhesus incompatibility, rhesus disease, RhD hemolytic disease of the newborn, rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn or RhD HDN) is a type of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). The disease ranges from mild to severe, and typically occurs only in some second or subsequent pregnancies of Rh negative women where the fetus's father is Rh positive, leading to a Rh+ pregnancy. During birth, the mother may be exposed to the infant's blood, and this causes the development of antibodies, which may affect the health of subsequent Rh+ pregnancies. In mild cases, the fetus may have mild anaemia with reticulocytosis. In moderate or severe cases the fetus may have a more marked anaemia and erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn). When the disease is very severe it may cause hydrops fetalis or stillbirth.
Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly.[3] Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion[3][4] There may be tea colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of the muscle breakdown products, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.[3]
Rhabdomyosarcoma, or RMS, is an aggressive and highly malignant form of cancer that develops from skeletal (striated) muscle cells that have failed to fully differentiate. It is generally considered to be a disease of childhood, as the vast majority of cases occur in those below the age of 18. It is commonly described as one of the "small, round, blue cell tumours of childhood" due to its appearance on an H&E stain. Despite being a relatively rare cancer, it accounts for approximately 40% of all recorded soft tissue sarcomas.[1][2][3] RMS can occur in any site on the body, but is primarily found in the head, neck, orbit, genitourinary tract, genitals, and extremities. There are no clear risk factors for RMS, but the disease has been associated with some congenital abnormalities.[1][4] Signs and symptoms vary according to tumor site, and prognosis is closely tied to the location of the primary tumor. Common site of metastasis include the lungs, bone marrow, and bones.[5][6] There are many classification systems for RMS and a variety of defined histological types. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type and comprises about 60% of cases.[7] Patient outcomes vary considerably, with 5 years survival rates between 35% and 95% depending on the type of RMS involved, so clear diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management.[7][8] Unfortunately, accurate and quick diagnosis is often difficult due to the heterogeneity of RMS tumors and a lack of strong genetic markers of the disease. Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Sixty percent to 70% of newly diagnosed patients with nonmetastatic disease can be cured using this combined approach to therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality treatment, less than 20% of patients with metastatic RMS are able to be cured of their disease.[9]
Rheumatic fever (RF), also known as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), is an inflammatory disease that can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain.[1] The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a streptococcal throat infection.[2] Signs and symptoms include fever, multiple painful joints, involuntary muscle movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of cases. Damage to the heart valves, known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.[1]
Rheumatism or rheumatic disorder is an umbrella term for conditions causing chronic, often intermittent pain affecting the joints and/or connective tissue. The study of, and therapeutic interventions in, such disorders is called rheumatology.[1] The term "rheumatism", however, does not designate any specific disorder, but covers at least 200[citation needed] different conditions.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present.[1] Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.[2]
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP),[help 1] also known as IgA vasculitis,[1] anaphylactoid purpura,[2] purpura rheumatica,[2] and Schönlein–Henoch purpura,[2] is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and sometimes other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.
Rheumatoid vasculitis is skin condition that is a typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis, presenting as peripheral vascular lesions that are localized purpura, cutaneous ulceration, and gangrene of the distal parts of the extremities.[1][2]
Nose-picking is the act of extracting nasal mucus with one's finger (rhinotillexis) and may include the succeeding action of ingesting the mucus picked from the nose (mucophagy).[1] This action is condemned in most cultures; societies try to prevent development of the habit and attempt to break it if already established. Mucophagy is a source of mockery and entertainment in the media.
Rickets is defective mineralization or calcification of bones before epiphyseal closure in immature mammals due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D,[1] phosphorus or calcium,[2] potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries. The predominant cause is a vitamin D deficiency, but lack of adequate calcium in the diet may also lead to rickets (cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency). Although it can occur in adults, the majority of cases occur in children suffering from severe malnutrition, usually resulting from famine or starvation during the early stages of childhood.
Rickettsialpox is a mite-borne infectious illness caused by bacteria of the Rickettsia genus (Rickettsia akari).[1] Physician Robert Huebner and self-trained entomologist Charles Pomerantz played major roles in identifying the etiology of the disease after an outbreak in 1946 in a New York City apartment complex, documented in "The Alerting of Mr. Pomerantz," a short story by medical writer Berton Roueché.
A rickettsiosis is a disease caused by intracellular bacteria. It has been predicted that global warming may lead to greater incidence.[1]
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease that can cause mild to severe symptoms. The mild symptoms may include: fever, muscle pains, and headaches which often last for up to a week. The severe symptoms may include: loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection, infections of the brain causing severe headaches and confusion, and bleeding together with liver problems which may occur within the first few days. Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.[1]
Roberts syndrome, or sometimes called pseudothalidomide syndrome, is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is characterized by mild to severe prenatal retardation or disruption of cell division, leading to malformation of the bones in the skull, face, arms, and legs.
Robinow syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, abnormalities in the head, face, and external genitalia, as well as vertebral segmentation. The disorder was first described in 1969 by human geneticist Meinhard Robinow,[1] along with physicians Frederic N. Silverman and Hugo D. Smith, in the American Journal of Diseases of Children. By 2002, over 100 cases had been documented and introduced into medical literature.[1]
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), also known as blue disease,[1] is the most lethal[2] and most frequently reported rickettsial illness in the United States. It has been diagnosed throughout the Americas. Some synonyms for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in other countries include “tick typhus,” “Tobia fever” (Colombia), “São Paulo fever” or “febre maculosa” (Brazil), and “fiebre manchada” (Mexico). It is distinct from the viral tick-borne infection, Colorado tick fever. The disease is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a species of bacterium that is spread to humans by Dermacentor ticks. Initial signs and symptoms of the disease include sudden onset of fever, headache, and muscle pain, followed by development of rash. The disease can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages, and without prompt and appropriate treatment it can be fatal.
Romano–Ward syndrome is the major variant of long QT syndrome. It is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. This disorder is a form of long QT syndrome, which is a heart condition that causes the cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can lead to fainting, seizures, or sudden death.
Rombo syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized mainly by atrophoderma vermiculatum of the face,[1]:580 multiple milia, telangiectases, acral erythema,[2] peripheral vasodilation with cyanosis[3] and a propensity to develop basal cell carcinomas.[2] The lesions become visible in late childhood, began at ages 7 to 10 years and are most pronounced on the face, At that time a pronounced, somewhat cyanotic redness of the lips and hands was evident as well as moderate follicular atrophy of the skin on the cheeks. In adulthood, whitish-yellow, milia-like papules and telangiectatic vessels developed. The papules were present particularly on the cheeks and forehead, gradually becoming very conspicuous and dominating the clinical picture. Trichoepitheliomas were found in 1 case. In adults, the eyelashes and eyebrows were either missing or irregularly distributed with defective and maldirected growth. Basal cell carcinomas were a frequent complication. The skin atrophy was referred to as vermiculate atrophoderma. Basal cell carcinomas may develop around the age of 35. Histological observations during the early stage include irregularly distributed and atrophic hair follicles, milia, dilated dermal vessels, lack of elastin or elastin in clumps. After light irradiation a tendency to increased repair activity was observed both in epidermis and in the dermal fibroblasts.[3] Histologic sections showed the dermis to be almost devoid of elastin in most areas with clumping of elastic material in other areas. The disorder had been transmitted through at least 4 generations with instances of male-to-male transmission.[3]
Rosai–Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by abundant histiocytes in the lymph nodes throughout the body.[1],[2]
Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS), also known as poikiloderma atrophicans with cataract or poikiloderma congenitale,[1][2] is a rare autosomal recessive[3][4] skin condition originally described by August von Rothmund (1830–1906) in 1868.[5] Matthew Sydney Thomson (1894–1969) published further descriptions in 1936.[6]
Rotor syndrome, also called Rotor type hyperbilirubinemia,[1] is a rare, relatively benign autosomal recessive[2] bilirubin disorder. It is a distinct, yet similar disorder to Dubin–Johnson syndrome[1] — both diseases cause an increase in conjugated bilirubin.
Rubella, also known as German measles or three-day measles,[1] is an infection caused by the rubella virus.[2] This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick.[3][4] A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks.[4] A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur.[4][5] In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves.[4] Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.[2]
Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RTS), also known as broad thumb-hallux syndrome or Rubinstein syndrome,[1] is a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe learning difficulties, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes.[2] Other features of the disorder vary among affected individuals. People with this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and cancerous tumors, leukemia, and lymphoma. This condition is sometimes inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern and is uncommon, many times it occurs as a de novo (not inherited) occurrence, it occurs in an estimated 1 in 125,000-300,000 births.
Rudiger syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by the association of severe growth retardation with abnormalities of the extremities, urogenital abnormalities and facial abnormalities.[1] It has been described in a family where an affected brother and sister died as infants.[2] Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been suggested with the disorder.[1][3]
Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic motility disorder characterized by effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, due to the involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen.[1] There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence is as high as 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities). Today it is being diagnosed in increasing numbers of otherwise healthy adolescents and adults, though there is a lack of awareness of the condition by doctors, patients and the general public.
Ruzicka Goerz Anton syndrome is a rare genetic disease described by Ruzicka et al. in 1981. It is characterized by icthyosis (rough, scaly skin), deafness, intellectual disability, and skeletal anomalies.[1][2]
Saal Bulas syndrome is listed as a "rare disease" by the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This means that Saal Bulas syndrome, or a subtype of Saal Bulas syndrome, affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US population.
Saal Greenstein syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by stunted growth, short limbs, microcephaly, and an anomalous cleavage of the anterior chamber of the eye. The disorder is similar to Robinow syndrome except for anterior chamber anomalies and, in one case, hydrocephalus.[1]
Sabinas brittle hair syndrome, also called Sabinas syndrome or brittle hair-mental deficit syndrome, is an autosomal recessive[1] congenital disorder affecting the integumentary system.
Saccharopinuria (an excess of saccharopine in the urine), also called saccharopinemia, saccharopine dehydrogenase deficiency or alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase deficiency,[1] is a variant form of hyperlysinemia.[2] It is caused by a partial deficiency of the enzyme saccharopine dehydrogenase, which plays a secondary role in the lysine metabolic pathway. Inheritance is thought to be autosomal recessive, but this cannot be established as individuals affected by saccharopinuria typically have only a 40% reduction in functional enzyme.[1]
Sadistic personality disorder is a personality disorder involving sadism which appeared in an appendix of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R).[1] The later versions of the DSM (DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5) do not include it.
Saethre–Chotzen syndrome (SCS), also known as Acrocephalosyndactyly type III is a rare congenital disorder associated with craniosynostosis (premature closure of one or more of the sutures between the bones of the skull). This affects the shape of the head and face, resulting in a cone-shaped head and an asymmetrical face. Individuals with SCS also have droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and minor birth defects of the hands and feet (syndactyly).[1] In addition, individuals with more severe cases of SCS may have mild to moderate mental retardation or learning disabilities. Depending on the level of severity, some individuals with SCS may require some form of medical or surgical intervention.[2] Most individuals with SCS live fairly normal lives, regardless of whether medical treatment is needed or not.[1]
Salla disease (SD), also called sialic acid storage disease or Finnish type sialuria,[1] is an autosomal recessive[2] lysosomal storage disease characterized by early physical impairment and mental retardation. It was first described in 1979,[3] after Salla, a municipality in Finnish Lapland. Salla disease is one of 40 Finnish heritage diseases and affects approximately 130 individuals, mainly from Finland and Sweden.
Salmonellosis is an infection caused by the Salmonella bacteria. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.[1] In some cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be hospitalized.
Sandhoff disease, also known as Sandhoff-Jatzkewitz disease, variant 0 of GM2-Gangliosidosis or Hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, is a lysosomal genetic, lipid storage disorder caused by the inherited deficiency to create functional beta-hexosaminidases A and B.[1][2] These catabolic enzymes are needed to degrade the neuronal membrane components, ganglioside GM2, its derivative GA2, the glycolipid globoside in visceral tissues,[1] and some oligosaccharides. Accumulation of these metabolites leads to a progressive destruction of the central nervous system and eventually to death.[1][3] The rare autosomal recessive[4][5] neurodegenerative disorder is clinically almost indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs disease, another genetic disorder that disrupts beta-hexosaminidases A and S. There are three subsets of Sandhoff disease based on when first symptoms appear: classic infantile, juvenile and adult late onset.
Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS-III) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. It is caused by a deficiency in one of the enzymes needed to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (which is found in the extra-cellular matrix and on cell surface glycoproteins).
SAPHO syndrome includes a variety of inflammatory bone disorders that may be associated with skin changes. These diseases share some clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics.
Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomas.[1] The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Any organ, however, can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often there are no, or only mild, symptoms.[1] When it affects the lungs there may be wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.[2] Some may have Löfgren syndrome in which there is fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.[1]
Sarcosinemia (SAR), also called hypersarcosinemia and SARDH deficiency,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive[2] metabolic disorder characterized by an increased concentration of sarcosine in blood plasma and urine ("sarcosinuria"). It can result from an inborn error of sarcosine metabolism, or from severe folate deficiency related to the folate requirement for the conversion of sarcosine to glycine. It is thought to be a relatively benign condition.[3]
Satoyoshi syndrome, also known as Komura-Guerri syndrome, is a rare progressive disorder of presumed autoimmune etiology, characterized by painful muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea, endocrinopathy with amenorrhoea and secondary skeletal abnormalities.[1] The syndrome was first reported in 1967 by Eijiro Satoyoshi and Kaneo Yamada in Tokyo, Japan. To this date, fewer than 50 cases worldwide have been reported for the Satoyoshi syndrome.[2]
Say–Meyer syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic disorder that is mostly characterized as developmental delay. It is one of the rare causes of short stature. It is closely related with trigonocephaly (a misshapen forehead due to premature fusion of bones in the skull). People with Say–Meyer syndrome have impaired growth, deficits in motor skills development and mental state.[1][2]
Scabies, previously known as the seven-year itch, is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei.[1][2] The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally tiny burrows may be seen in the skin. When first infected, usually two to six weeks are required before symptoms occur. If a person develops a second infection later in life, symptoms may begin within a day. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin.[3]
Scalp–ear–nipple syndrome (also known as "Finlay–Marks syndrome") is a condition associated with aplasia cutis congenita.[1]
SCARF syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by skeletal abnormalities, cutis laxa, craniostenosis, ambiguous genitalia, retardation, and facial abnormalities. It shares some features with Lenz-Majewski hyperostotic dwarfism syndrome.
Scarlet fever can occur as a result of a group A Streptococcus (group A strep) infection.[1] The signs and symptoms include a sore throat, fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, and a characteristic rash. The rash is red and feels like sandpaper and the tongue may be red and bumpy. It most commonly affects children between five and fifteen years of age.[1]
Scheie syndrome (also known as "MPS I-S") is less severe version of Hurler syndrome. It is a condition characterized by corneal clouding, facial dysmorphism, and normal lifespan.[1][2] People with this condition may have aortic regurgitation.[3]
Scheuermann's disease is a self-limiting skeletal disorder of childhood. Scheuermann's disease describes a condition where the vertebrae grow unevenly with respect to the sagittal plane; that is, the posterior angle is often greater than the anterior. This uneven growth results in the signature "wedging" shape of the vertebrae, causing kyphosis. It is named after Holger Werfel Scheuermann.[1][2][3] 
Schindler disease, also known as Kanzaki disease and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency is a rare disease found in humans. This lysosomal storage disorder is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-NAGA (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), attributable to mutations in the NAGA gene on chromosome 22,[1][2] which leads to excessive lysosomal accumulation of glycoproteins.[3] A deficiency of the alpha-NAGA enzyme leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids throughout the body. This accumulation of sugars gives rise to the clinical features associated with this disorder. Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that one must inherit an abnormal allele from both parents in order to have the disease.
Schinzel–Giedion syndrome is a congenital neurodegenerative terminal syndrome. First described in 1978 by Dr. Albert Schinzel (1944- )and Dr. Andreas Giedion (1925- )[1][2] as a syndrome with severe midface retraction, skull anomalies, renal anomalies (hydronephrosis) and other anomalies. Babies born with Schinzel–Giedion syndrome have severe mental retardation, growth retardation (unless fed through a feeding tube) and global developmental delay.

Schizencephaly (from Greek skhizein, meaning "to split", and enkephalos, meaning "brain")[1][2] is a rare birth defect characterized by abnormal clefts lined with grey matter that form the ependyma of the cerebral ventricles to the pia mater. These clefts can occur bilaterally or unilaterally. Common clinical features of this malformation include epilepsy, motor deficits, and psychomotor retardation.[3]
Schizoaffective disorder (SZA, SZD or SAD) is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal thought processes and deregulated emotions.[1][2] The diagnosis is made when the patient has features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder—either bipolar disorder or depression—but does not strictly meet diagnostic criteria for either alone.[1][2] The bipolar type is distinguished by symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episode; the depressive type by symptoms of depression only.[1][2] Common symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and disorganized speech and thinking.[3] The onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood, currently with an uncertain lifetime prevalence because the disorder was redefined, but DSM-IV prevalence estimates were less than 1 percent of the population, in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.[4] Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient's reported experiences.
Schizoid personality disorder (SPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, and apathy. Affected individuals may simultaneously demonstrate a rich, elaborate and exclusively internal fantasy world.[1][2][page needed]
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real.[2] Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation.[2][3] People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety disorders, major depressive illness, or substance use disorders.[4] Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.[3][5]
Schizophreniform disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed when symptoms of schizophrenia are present for a significant portion of the time within a one-month period, but signs of disruption are not present for the full six months required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.
Schizotypal personality disorder (STPD) or schizotypal disorder is a mental disorder characterized by severe social anxiety, paranoia, and often unconventional beliefs. People with this disorder feel extreme discomfort with maintaining close relationships with people, mainly because they think that their peers harbor negative thoughts towards them, so they avoid forming them. Peculiar speech mannerisms and odd modes of dress are also symptoms of this disorder. Those with STPD may react oddly in conversations, not respond or talk to themselves. Some have a tendency to drift aimlessly and lead an idle, unproductive life.[1][2]
Schmitt Gillenwater Kelly syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant[1] congenital disorder consisting of radial hypoplasia, triphalangeal thumbs, hypospadias, and maxillary diastema.[1][2]
Schwannomatosis is one form of a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis (NF) that has only recently been recognized. Originally described in Japanese patients,[1] it consists of multiple cutaneous schwannomas, central nervous system tumors, and other neurological complications, excluding hallmark signs of NF. It is a rare disorder, affecting only around 1 in 40,000 individuals.[2]
Schwartz–Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation in the HSPG2 gene, which makes the protein perlecan,[1] and causing osteochondrodysplasia associated with myotonia.[2]
Sciatica is a medical condition characterized by pain going down the leg from the lower back.[1] This pain may go down the back, outside, or front of the leg. Typically, symptoms are only on one side of the body. Certain causes, however, may result in pain on both sides. Lower back pain is sometimes but not always present. Weakness or numbness may occur in various parts of the affected leg and foot.[2]
Scimitar syndrome, or pulmonary venolobar syndrome, is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by anomalous venous return from the right lung (to the systemic venous drainage, rather than directly to the left atrium).[1] This anomalous pulmonary venous return can be either partial (PAPVR) or total (TAPVR). The syndrome associated with PAPVR is more commonly known as Scimitar syndrome after the curvilinear pattern created on a chest radiograph by the pulmonary veins that drain to the inferior vena cava.[2] This radiographic density often has the shape of a scimitar, a type of curved sword.[2]
Scleredema, also known as Buschke disease, scleredema of Buschke, and scleredema adultorum,[1][2] is a rare, self-limiting skin condition defined by progressive thickening and hardening of the skin, usually on the areas of the upper back, neck, shoulders and face.[3] The skin may also change color to red or orange. The disease was discovered by Abraham Buschke. Although the cause of scleredema is unknown, it is usually associated with a disease, usually diabetes,[4] a viral illness or strep throat.[5] It is usually not fatal, but it may cause death if the disease spreads to the internal organs.[3] It may also cause an infection.[5]
Scleroderma is a long term autoimmune disease that results in hardening of the skin. In the more severe form, it also affects internal organs.[1][2] The cause is unknown.[1] The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking healthy tissues.[1] There is a strong association with certain mutations in HLA genes.[3][4] Environmental factors have also been implicated.[5][6]
Scott syndrome is a rare congenital bleeding disorder that is due to a defect in a platelet mechanism required for blood coagulation.[1]
Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats.[1] It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which are related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease") and chronic wasting disease of deer. Like other spongiform encephalopathies, scrapie is caused by a prion.[2] Scrapie has been known since 1732, and does not appear to be transmissible to humans.[3][4]
Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C.[1] Early symptoms include weakness, feeling tired, curly hair, and sore arms and legs.[1][2] Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, and bleeding from the skin may occur.[1] As scurvy worsens there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.[2]
Scoliosis is a medical condition in which a person's spine has a sideways curve.[2] The curve is usually "S" or "C" shaped.[2] In some the degree of curve is stable, while in others it increases over time. Mild scoliosis does not typically cause problems, while severe cases can interfere with breathing.[3][4] Pain is typically not present.[5]
A scotoma (Greek σκότος/skótos, darkness; plural: scotomas or scotomata) is an area of partial alteration in the field of vision consisting of a partially diminished or entirely degenerated visual acuity that is surrounded by a field of normal – or relatively well-preserved – vision.
Sea-blue histiocytosis is a cutaneous condition that may occur as a familial inherited syndrome or as an acquired secondary or systemic infiltrative process.[1]:720
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as winter depression, winter blues, summer depression or seasonal depression, is a mood disorder subset in which people who have normal mental health throughout most of the year experience depressive symptoms at the same time each year, most commonly in the winter.[1][2]
Seaver Cassidy syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by certain facial, genital, and skeletal deformities, as well as an unusual susceptibility to bleeding.[1] Seaver Cassidy syndrome was first described in 1991 by Laurie Seaver and Suzanne Cassidy.[2]
The Seckel syndrome or microcephalic primordial dwarfism (also known as bird-headed dwarfism, Harper's syndrome, Virchow-Seckel dwarfism, and Bird-headed dwarf of Seckel[1]) is an extremely rare congenital nanosomic disorder.
Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective mutism usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety.[1] People with selective mutism stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism or even punishment.[2]
Self-defeating personality disorder (also known as masochistic personality disorder) is a proposed personality disorder. It was discussed in an appendix of the manual's revised third edition (DSM-III-R) in 1987, but was never formally admitted into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). As an alternative, the diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified may be used. Some researchers and theorists continue to use its criteria. It has an official code number, 301.90.[1]
Seminoma (also known as pure seminoma or classical seminoma) is a germ cell tumor of the testicle or, more rarely, the mediastinum or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a malignant neoplasm and is one of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.[1]
Senior–Løken syndrome is a congenital eye disorder, first characterized in 1961.[1][2][3] It is a rare, ciliopathic, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by nephronophthisis and progressive eye disease.[4]
Sensenbrenner syndrome (OMIM #218330) is a rare (less than 20 cases reported by 2010) multisystem disease first described in 1975.[1] It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and a number of genes appear to be responsible. Three genes responsible have been identified: intraflagellar transport (IFT)122 (WDR10),[2] IFT43 — a subunit of the IFT complex A machinery of primary cilia,[3] and WDR35 (IFT121: TULP4)[4]
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a type of hearing loss, or deafness, in which the root cause lies in the inner ear or sensory organ (cochlea and associated structures) or the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) or neural part. SNHL accounts for about 90% of hearing loss reported. SNHL is generally permanent and can be mild, moderate, severe, profound, or total. Various other descriptors can be used such as high frequency, low frequency, U-shaped, notched, peaked or flat depending on the shape of the audiogram, the measure of hearing.
Sensory processing disorder (SPD; also known as sensory integration dysfunction) is a condition that exists when multisensory integration is not adequately processed in order to provide appropriate responses to the demands of the environment.
Senter syndrome (also known as "Desmons' syndrome")[1] is a cutaneous condition characterized by similar skin changes and congenital hearing impairment to keratitis–ichthyosis–deafness syndrome, but is associated with glycogen storage leading to hepatomegaly, hepatic cirrhosis, growth failure and mental retardation.[2]
Separation anxiety disorder (SAD), is an anxiety disorder in which an individual experiences excessive anxiety regarding separation from home or from people to whom the individual has a strong emotional attachment (e.g. a parent, caregiver, significant other or siblings). It is most common in infants and small children, typically between the ages of 6–7 months to 3 years. Separation anxiety is a natural part of the developmental process. Unlike SAD (indicated by excessive anxiety), normal separation anxiety indicates healthy advancements in a child’s cognitive maturation and should not be considered a developing behavioral problem.[1]
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues and organs.[1] Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion.[2] There also may be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. In the very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system, there may be no symptoms of a specific infection and the body temperature may be low or normal, rather than high.[3] Severe sepsis is sepsis causing poor organ function or insufficient blood flow. Insufficient blood flow may be evident by low blood pressure, high blood lactate, or low urine output. Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after reasonable amounts of intravenous fluids are given.[4]
Septic shock is a serious medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism.[1]
Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), (de Morsier syndrome)[1][2] is a rare congenital malformation syndrome featuring underdevelopment of the optic nerve, pituitary gland dysfunction, and absence of the septum pellucidum (a midline part of the brain). Two of these features need to be present for a clinical diagnosis — only 30% of patients have all three.[3]
Serum sickness in humans is a reaction to proteins in antiserum derived from a non-human animal source, occurring 4–10 days after exposure. It is a type of hypersensitivity, specifically immune complex hypersensitivity (type III). The term serum sickness-like reaction (SSLR) is occasionally used to refer to similar illnesses that arise from the introduction of certain non-protein substances.[1] It was first characterized by Clemens von Pirquet and Béla Schick in 1906.[2]
Setleis syndrome is a cutaneous condition characterized double upper and absent lower lashes.[1]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries,[1] with the majority of cases in Hong Kong[2] (9.6% fatality rate) according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[2] No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004.[3]
Severe combined immunodeficiency, SCID, also known as alymphocytosis, Glanzmann–Riniker syndrome, severe mixed immunodeficiency syndrome, and thymic alymphoplasia,[1] is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the disturbed development of functional T cells and B cells caused by numerous genetic mutations that result in heterogeneous clinical presentations.[2] SCID involves defective antibody response due to either direct involvement with B lymphocytes or through improper B lymphocyte activation due to non-functional T-helper cells.[3] Consequently, both "arms" (B cells and T cells) of the adaptive immune system are impaired due to a defect in one of several possible genes. SCID is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiencies,[4] and there are now at least nine different known genes in which mutations lead to a form of SCID.[5] It is also known as the bubble boy disease and bubble baby disease because its victims are extremely vulnerable to infectious diseases and some of them, such as David Vetter, have become famous for living in a sterile environment. SCID is the result of an immune system so highly compromised that it is considered almost absent.
Shapiro syndrome is an extremely rare disorder consisting of paroxysmal hypothermia (due to hypothalamic dysfunction of thermoregulation), hyperhydrosis (sweating), and agenesis of the corpus callosum with onset typically on adulthood. The disease affects about 50 people worldwide. The duration and frequency of the episodes vary from person to person, with some episodes lasting hours to weeks and occurring from hours to years. Very little is known about the disease due to the small number of people affected.[1]
Shellfish poisoning includes four (4) syndromes that share some common features and are primarily associated with bivalve molluscs (such as mussels, clams, oysters and scallops.)[1] These shellfish are filter feeders and, therefore, accumulate toxins produced by microscopic algae, such as cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates.
Shigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery or Marlow syndrome, in its most severe manifestation, is a foodborne illness caused by infection by bacteria of the genus Shigella. Shigellosis rarely occurs in animals other than humans.[1]
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area.[1][2] Typically the rash occurs in a single stripe either on the left or right of the body or face.[3] Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.[3][4] Otherwise there are typically few symptoms.[3] The rash usually heals within two to four weeks;[1] however, some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia. In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely.[3] If the rash involves the eye, vision loss may occur.[1]
Circulatory shock, commonly known as shock, is a life-threatening medical condition of low blood perfusion to tissues resulting in cellular injury and inadequate tissue function.[1][2] The typical signs of shock are low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, signs of poor end-organ perfusion (i.e.: low urine output, confusion, or loss of consciousness), and weak pulses.
Short bowel syndrome (SBS, or simply short gut) is a malabsorption disorder caused by a lack of functional small intestine.[1] The primary symptom is diarrhea, which can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include bloating, heartburn, feeling tired, lactose intolerance, and foul smelling stool.[2] Complications can include anemia and kidney stones.[3]
Short QT syndrome is a genetic disease of the electrical system of the heart. It consists of a constellation of signs and symptoms, consisting of a short QT interval on an EKG (≤ 300 ms) that does not significantly change with heart rate, tall and peaked T waves, and a structurally normal heart. Short QT syndrome appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and a few affected families have been identified.
Shwartzman phenomenon, also known as Shwartzman reaction, is a rare reaction of a body to particular types of toxins, called endotoxins, which cause thrombosis in the affected tissue. A clearing of the thrombosis results in a reticuloendothelial blockade, which prevents re-clearing of the thrombosis caused by a repeat introduction of the toxin. That will cause tissue necrosis. Shwartzman phenomenon is usually observed during delivery or abortion, when foreign bodies are introduced into the tissues of the female reproductive system.
Sialadenitis (sialoadenitis) is inflammation of a salivary gland. It may be subdivided temporally into acute, chronic and recurrent forms.
Mucolipidosis type I (ML I) or sialidosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-N -acetyl neuraminidase (sialidase).[1] The lack of this enzyme results in an abnormal accumulation of complex carbohydrates known as mucopolysaccharides, and of fatty substances known as mucolipids. Both of these substances accumulate in bodily tissues.
Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person's parents.[1] The most common type is known as sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin (hemoglobin S) found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid, sickle-like shape under certain circumstances.[1] Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain ("sickle-cell crisis"), anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, and stroke.[2] Long term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years.[1]
Siderosis is the deposition of iron in tissue.
Silent sinus syndrome is a spontaneous, asymptomatic collapse of the maxillary sinus and orbital floor associated with negative sinus pressures. It can cause painless facial asymmetry, diplopia and enophthalmos. Usually the diagnosis is suspected clinically, and it can be confirmed radiologically by characteristic imaging features that include maxillary sinus outlet obstruction, sinus opacification, and sinus volume loss caused by inward retraction of the sinus walls. Treatment is surgical involving making an outlet for mucous drainage from the obstructed sinus.
Silicosis (previously miner's phthisis, grinder's asthma, potter's rot and other occupation-related names)[1] is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis.[2]
Silver–Russell dwarfism, also called Silver–Russell syndrome (SRS) or Russell–Silver syndrome (RSS) is a growth disorder occurring in approximately 1/50,000 to 1/100,000 births. In the United States it is usually referred to as Russell–Silver syndrome, and Silver–Russell syndrome elsewhere. It is one of 200 types of dwarfism and one of five types of primordial dwarfism and is one of the few forms that is considered treatable in some cases.
Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome (SGBS), also called Bulldog syndrome, Sara Agers syndrome, Golabi–Rosen syndrome, Simpson dysmorphia syndrome (SDYS) or X-linked dysplasia gigantism syndrome (DGSX),[1] is a rare inherited congenital disorder that can cause craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac, and renal abnormalities. The syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion,[2] where males express the phenotype and females usually do not. Females that possess one copy of the mutation are considered to be carriers of the syndrome and may express varying degrees of the phenotype.
Singleton Merten Syndrome is an autosomal dominate genetic disorder with variable expression with an onset of symptoms during childhood.
Sirenomelia, alternatively known as Mermaid Syndrome, is a rare congenital deformity in which the legs are fused together, giving them the appearance of a mermaid's tail.
Sitosterolemia (also known as "Phytosterolemia"[1]:535) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder. It is characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols leading to hypercholesterolemia, tendon and tuberous xanthomas, premature development of atherosclerosis, and abnormal hematologic and liver function test results.
Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, is a disorder associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve), which is responsible for causing contraction of the lateral rectus muscle to abduct (i.e., turn out) the eye. The inability of an eye to turn outward results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is diplopia (commonly known as double vision) in which the two images appear side-by-side. The condition is commonly unilateral but can also occur bilaterally.
Sjögren–Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive form of ichthyosis apparent at birth.[1]:485[2]:564[3] Sjögren–Larsson syndrome is a rare autosomal, recessive, neurocutaneous disease. This disease can be identified by a triad of medical disorders. The first is ichthyosis, which is a buildup of skin to form a scale-like covering that causes dry skin and other problems. The second identifier is spastic paraplegia which is characterized by leg spasms. The final identifier is intellectual delay. The gene of SLS is found on chromosome 17. In order for a child to receive SLS both parents must be carriers of the SLS gene. If they are carriers their child has a ¼ chance of getting the disease. In 1957 Sjogren and Larsson proposed that the Swedes with the disease all descended from a common ancestor 600 years ago. Today only 30-40 persons in Sweden have this disease.[4]
Sjögren's syndrome (SjS, SS) is a long-term autoimmune disease in which the moisture-producing glands of the body are affected.[2] This results primarily in the development of a dry mouth and dry eyes.[3] Other symptoms can include dry skin, a chronic cough, vaginal dryness, numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems.[2] Those affected are at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma.[3][4]
Sly syndrome, also called Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII or MPS, is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme β-glucuronidase, a lysosomal enzyme. Sly syndrome belongs to a group of disorders known as mucopolysaccharidoses, which are lysosomal storage diseases. In Sly syndrome, the deficiency in β-glucuronidase leads to the accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides) in many tissues and organs of the body.
Smallpox was an infectious disease caused by either of two virus variants, Variola major and Variola minor.[1] The disease is also known by the Latin names variola or variola vera, derived from varius ("spotted") or varus ("pimple"). The disease was originally known in English as the "pox"[2] or "red plague";[3] the term "smallpox" was first used in Britain in the 15th century to distinguish variola from the "great pox" (syphilis).[4] The last naturally occurring case of smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed on 26 October 1977.[5]
Smith–Fineman–Myers syndrome (SFMS1), also called X-linked mental retardation-hypotonic facies syndrome 1 (MRXHF1), Carpenter–Waziri syndrome, Chudley–Lowry syndrome, SFMS, Holmes–Gang syndrome and Juberg–Marsidi syndrome (JMS),[1] is a rare X-linked recessive[2] congenital disorder that causes birth defects. This syndrome was named after 3 men, Richard D. Smith, Robert M. Fineman and Gart G. Myers who discovered it around 1980.[3]
Smith–Magenis Syndrome (SMS) is a developmental disorder affecting the body and brain. Features include intellectual disability, facial features such as a broad face, difficulty sleeping, and numerous behavioral problems. Smith–Magenis syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 25,000 individuals. [1]
Sneddon's syndrome[1] is a form of arteriopathy characterized by several symptoms, including:
Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is an anxiety disorder characterized by a significant amount of fear in one or more social situations causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life.[1]:15 These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others.
A soft-tissue sarcoma is a form of sarcoma that develops in connective tissue,[1] though the term is sometimes applied to elements of the soft tissue that are not currently considered connective tissue. 
Somatization disorder (also Briquet's syndrome) was a mental disorder characterized by recurring, multiple, and current, clinically significant complaints about somatic symptoms, although it is no longer considered a clinical diagnosis. It was recognized in the DSM-IV-TR classification system, but in the latest version DSM-5, it was combined with undifferentiated somatoform disorder to become somatic symptom disorder, a diagnosis which no longer requires a specific number of somatic symptoms.[1] ICD-10, the latest version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, still includes somatization syndrome.[2]
Somatostatinoma is a malignant tumor of the delta cells of the endocrine pancreas that produces somatostatin. Increased levels of somatostatin inhibit pancreatic hormones and gastrointestinal hormones. Thus somatostatinomas are associated with mild diabetes mellitus (due to inhibition of insulin release), steatorrhoea and gallstones (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin release), and achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin release). Somatostatinomas are commonly found in head of pancreas.
Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism or Sotos-Dodge syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive physical growth during the first years of life. Excessive growth often starts in infancy and continues into the early teen years. The disorder may be accompanied by autism,[1] mild intellectual disability, delayed motor, cognitive, and social development, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and speech impairments. Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and are often taller, heavier, and have relatively large skulls (macrocephaly) than is normal for their age. Signs of the disorder, which vary among individuals, include a disproportionately large skull with a slightly protrusive forehead, large hands and feet, large mandible, hypertelorism (an abnormally increased distance between the eyes)(large inter-pupillary distance), and downslanting eyes. Clumsiness, an awkward gait, and unusual aggressiveness or irritability may also occur. Although most cases of Sotos syndrome occur sporadically, familial cases have also been reported. It is similar to Weaver syndrome.
Spasmodic dysphonia (or laryngeal dystonia) is a voice disorder characterized by involuntary movements or spasms of one or more muscles of the larynx (vocal folds or voice box) during speech.[1]
Spasmodic torticollis is an extremely painful chronic neurological movement disorder causing the neck to involuntarily turn to the left, right, upwards, and/or downwards. The condition is also referred to as "cervical dystonia". Both agonist and antagonist muscles contract simultaneously during dystonic movement.[1] Causes of the disorder are predominantly idiopathic. A small number of patients develop the disorder as a result of another disorder or disease. Most patients first experience symptoms midlife. The most common treatment for spasmodic torticollis is the use of botulinum toxin type A.
A specific phobia is any kind of anxiety disorder that amounts to an unreasonable or irrational fear related to exposure to specific objects or situations. As a result, the affected person tends to actively avoid direct contact with the objects or situations and, in severe cases, any mention or depiction of them. The fear can, in fact, be disabling to their daily lives.[1]
Spermatogenesis arrest is a complex process of interruption in the differentiation of germinal cells of specific cellular type, which elicits an altered spermatozoa formation. Spermatogenic arrest is usually due to genetic factors resulting in irreversible azoospermia. However some cases may be consecutive to hormonal, thermic, or toxic factors and may be reversible either spontaneously or after a specific treatment.
Spherocytosis is an auto-hemolytic anemia (a disease of the blood) characterized by the production of spherocytes (red blood cells (RBCs)) or erythrocytes that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped. Spherocytes are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree. Hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are characterized by having only spherocytes.[1]
Spina bifida is a birth defect where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele.[1] The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases it may be the middle back or neck.[2] Occulta has no or only mild signs.[3] Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back at the site of the gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine.[1] Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy.[4] Learning problems are relatively uncommon.[4]
Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as spinobulbar muscular atrophy, bulbo-spinal atrophy, X-linked bulbospinal neuropathy (XBSN), X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMAX1), Kennedy's disease (KD), and many other names,[1] is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder resulting in muscle cramps and progressive weakness due to degeneration of motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord.[2]
A spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either temporary or permanent. These changes translate into loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function in parts of the body served by the spinal cord below the level of the lesion. Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury, a total loss of sensation and muscle function, or incomplete, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord, the symptoms can vary widely, from pain or numbness to paralysis to incontinence. The prognosis also ranges widely, from full recovery in rare cases to permanent tetraplegia (also called quadriplegia) in injuries at the level of the neck, and paraplegia in lower injuries. Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy, pressure sores, infections, and respiratory problems.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), also called autosomal recessive proximal spinal muscular atrophy in order to distinguish it from other conditions with similar name, is a rare neuromuscular disorder characterised by loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting, often leading to early death.
Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME), sometimes called Jankovic–Rivera syndrome, is a very rare neurodegenerative disease whose symptoms include slowly progressive muscle wasting (atrophy), predominantly affecting distal muscles, combined with denervation and myoclonic seizures.[1]
Spinal shock was first defined by Whytt in 1750 as a loss of sensation accompanied by motor paralysis with initial loss but gradual recovery of reflexes, following a spinal cord injury (SCI) – most often a complete transection. Reflexes in the spinal cord below the level of injury are depressed (hyporeflexia) or absent (areflexia), while those above the level of the injury remain unaffected. The 'shock' in spinal shock does not refer to circulatory collapse, and should not be confused with neurogenic shock, which is life-threatening
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), also known as spinocerebellar atrophy or spinocerebellar degeneration, is a progressive, degenerative,[1] genetic disease with multiple types, each of which could be considered a disease in its own right. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age. The disease is caused by either a recessive or dominant gene. In many cases people are not aware that they carry a relevant gene until they have children who begin to show signs of having the disorder.[2]
Splenic flexure syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe bloating, muscle spasms of the colon, and upper abdominal discomfort thought to be caused by trapped gas at the splenic (as opposed to hepatic) flexure in the colon; the pain caused can be excruciating and debilitating, and may mimic that of a heart attack (because of the proximity of the splenic flexure to the diaphragm and referred pain from irritation to the diaphragmatic sensory nerves).
Splenomegaly is an enlargement of the spleen. The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the human abdomen. Splenomegaly is one of the four cardinal signs of hypersplenism which include; some reduction in the number of circulating blood cells affecting granulocytes, erythrocytes or platelets in any combination, a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow, and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by splenectomy. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in hemolytic anemias), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any disease process that involves abnormal red blood cells being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to portal hypertension and infiltration by leukemias and lymphomas. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen, along with caput medusa, is an important sign of portal hypertension.[1]
Spondylitis is an inflammation of the vertebra. It is a form of spondylopathy. In many cases spondylitis involves one or more vertebral joints as well, which itself is called spondylarthritis.
Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia is a genetic condition affecting the bones.[1]
Sporotrichosis (also known as "Rose gardener's disease"[1]) is a disease caused by the infection of the fungus Sporothrix schenckii.[2] This fungal disease usually affects the skin, although other rare forms can affect the lungs, joints, bones, and even the brain. Because roses can spread the disease, it is one of a few diseases referred to as rose-thorn or rose-gardeners' disease.[3]
A spotted fever is a type of tick-borne disease which presents on the skin.[1] They are all caused by bacteria of the genus Rickettsia. Typhus is a group of similar diseases also caused by Rickettsia bacteria, but spotted fevers and typhus are different clinical entities.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC or SqCC), also known as squamous cell cancer, is cancer that begins from squamous cells, a type of skin cell.[1] It is one of the main types of skin cancer. Cancers that involve the anus, cervix, head and neck, and vagina are also most often squamous cell cancers.[1] The esophagus, urinary bladder, prostate, and lung are other possible sites.
Staphylococcus is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that can cause a wide variety of infections in humans and other animals through infection or the production of toxins. Staphylococcal toxins are a common cause of food poisoning, as they can be produced in improperly-stored food. Staphylococci are also known to be a cause of bacterial conjunctivitis.[1] Staphylococcus aureus can cause a number of different skin diseases.[2] Among neurosurgical patients, it can cause community-acquired meningitis.[3]
Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive, round-shaped bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes, and is frequently found in the nose, respiratory tract, and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen.[1] Although S. aureus is not always pathogenic, it is a common cause of skin infections such as a skin abscess, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of cell-surface proteins that bind and inactivate antibodies. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development there is no approved vaccine for S. aureus.
Staphylococcus albus Rosenbach 1884
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, (SSSS), also known as Pemphigus neonatorum or Ritter's disease,[1] or Localized bullous impetigo is a dermatological condition caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
Stargardt disease, or fundus flavimaculatus, is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Stargardt causes progressive vision loss usually to the point of legal blindness. Several genes are associated with the disorder. Symptoms, mainly central vision loss, typically develop before age 20 (median age of onset: ~17 years old), and also include wavy vision, blind spots, blurriness, impaired color vision, and difficulty adapting to dim lighting (dark adaptation delays).
Steatocystoma multiplex, also known as epidermal polycystic disease and sebocystomatosis,[1]:781 is a benign, autosomal dominant congenital condition resulting in multiple cysts on a person's body.
Sternal clefts are rare congenital malformations that result from defective embryologic fusion of paired mesodermal bands in the ventral midline.[1] They may be associated with other midline defects (as in pentalogy of Cantrell). It may also occur in isolation.[2] Sternal cleft is treated by surgery in early life to avoid fixation leading to immobility.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome, a form of toxic epidermal necrolysis, is a life-threatening skin condition, in which cell death causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis. The syndrome is thought to be a hypersensitivity complex that affects the skin and the mucous membranes. The best known causes are certain medications (such as lamotrigine), but it can also be due to infections, or more rarely, cancers.[2]
Stickler syndrome (hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy) is a group of genetic disorders affecting connective tissue, specifically collagen.[1] Stickler syndrome is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI. Stickler syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial abnormalities, ocular problems, hearing loss, and joint problems. It was first studied and characterized by Gunnar B. Stickler in 1965.[1]
Stiff person syndrome (SPS), also known as stiff man syndrome (SMS),[1] is a rare neurologic disorder of unclear etiology characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness. The stiffness primarily affects the truncal muscles and is superimposed by spasms, resulting in postural deformities. Chronic pain, impaired mobility, and lumbar hyperlordosis are common symptoms.
Stiff skin syndrome (also known as "Congenital fascial dystrophy"[1]) is a cutaneous condition characterized by ‘rock hard’ induration, thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, limited joint mobility, and mild hypertrichosis in infancy or early childhood. Immunologic abnormalities or vascular hyperactivity are not present in patients.[1]
Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of persistent high spiking fevers, joint pain, and a distinctive salmon-colored bumpy rash. The disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.[1] Levels of the iron-binding protein ferritin may be elevated with this disorder. AOSD may present in a similar manner to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases, which must be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Prognosis is usually favorable but manifestations of the disease affecting the lungs, heart, or kidney may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications.[2] It is treated first with steroids such as prednisone. Drugs that block the action of interleukin-1, particularly IL-1β, are effective treatments.[citation needed]
Stimmler syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive[1] congenital disorder first described by Stimmler et al. in 1970.[2] It is characterized by dwarfism, diabetes, a small head, and high levels of alanine in the urine.[3]
Stimulant psychosis is a psychosis symptom which typically occurs following an overdose on psychostimulants, but it also occurs in approximately 0.1% of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine or methylphenidate therapy.[1][2][3]
Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach.[1] Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others.[2] The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes.[3]
Stomatitis is inflammation of the mouth and lips.[1] It refers to any inflammatory process affecting the mucous membranes of the mouth and lips, with or without oral ulceration.[2]
Strabismus, also called crossed eyes, is a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object.[1] Which eye is focused on the object in question can switch. It may also be present occasionally or constantly. If present during a large part of childhood amblyopia may result and depth perception may be lost. Adults may have double vision.[2]
Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the nematode (roundworm) called Strongyloides stercoralis, or sometimes S. fülleborni which is a type of helminth. It belongs to a group of nematodes called roundworms. This intestinal worm can cause a number of symptoms in people, principally skin symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. In some people, particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated. The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests. The medication ivermectin is widely used to treat strongyloidiasis.
Strychnine poisoning can be fatal to humans and other animals and can occur by inhalation, swallowing or absorption through eyes or mouth. It produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction. For this reason, strychnine poisoning is often portrayed in literature and film.
Sturge–Weber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, mental retardation, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). Sturge Weber Syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is not any evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma. The symptoms can include glaucoma, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge Weber Syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively. The facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs. This type is only diagnosed via brain scan.[1]
Stye, also known as hordeolum, is an infection of an oil gland in the eyelid.[2] This results in a red tender bump at the edge of the eyelid.[1][3] The outside or the inside of the eyelid can be affected.[4]
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) also known as Dawson Disease, Dawson encephalitis, and measles encephalitis is a rare and chronic form of progressive brain inflammation caused by a persistent infection with measles virus (which can be a result of a mutation of the virus itself). The condition primarily affects children and young adults. It has been estimated that about 1 in 10,000 people infected with measles will eventually develop SSPE.[1] However, a 2016 study estimated that the rate for babies who contracted measles was as high as 1 in 609.[2] No cure for SSPE exists and the condition is often fatal. However, SSPE can be managed by medication if treatment is started at an early stage. Much of the work on SSPE has been performed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).
Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), also known as 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria or gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder[1] of the degradation pathway of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. The disorder has been identified in approximately 350 families, with a significant proportion being consanguineous families.[2] The first case was identified in 1981 and published in a Dutch clinical chemistry journal that highlighted a person with a number of neurological conditions such as delayed intellectual, motor, speech, and language as the most common manifestations. Later cases reported in the early 1990s began to show that hypotonia, hyporeflexia, seizures, and a nonprogressive ataxia were frequent clinical features as well.[3]
Sucrose intolerance, also called congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID),[1] sucrase-isomaltase deficiency,[2] genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (GSID) or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, is the condition in which sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme needed for proper metabolism of sucrose (sugar) and starch (i.e., grains and rice), is not produced or the enzyme produced is either partially functional or non-functional in the small intestine. All GSID patients lack fully functional sucrase, while the isomaltase activity can vary from minimal functionality to almost normal activity. The presence of residual isomaltase activity may explain why some GSID patients are better able to tolerate starch in their diet than others with GSID. The highest prevalence rates are seen in the Inuit populations of Greenland (5–10%), Alaska (3–7%) and Canada (about 3%). European descent prevalence ranges from 0.2% to 0.05%. There is a lower prevalence reported in African Americans and Hispanics compared to Caucasians.[3] [4]
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child less than one year of age.[1] Diagnosis requires that the death remains unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation.[2] SIDS usually occurs during sleep.[3] Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00.[4] There is usually no evidence of struggle and no noise produced.[5]
Sugarman syndrome is the common name of autosomal recessive oral-facial-digital syndrome type III, one of ten distinct genetic disorders that involve developmental defects to the mouth.[1]
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery. This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 6°-25° between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 38°-56°, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 2-8 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 10-20.[1] However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.[2]
Fabry disease (/ˈfɑːbri/) (also known as Fabry's disease, Anderson-Fabry disease, angiokeratoma corporis diffusum, and alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease, inherited in an X-linked manner. Fabry disease can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms.[1] It is a form of sphingolipidosis, as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids. The disease is named after one of its discoverers, Johannes Fabry (June 1, 1860 – June 29, 1930).[2]
Swine influenza, also called pig influenza, swine flu, hog flu and pig flu, is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza viruses. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs.[2] As of 2009, the known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3.
Sydenham's chorea (SC) or chorea minor (historically referred to as Saint Vitus Dance) is a disorder characterized by rapid, uncoordinated jerking movements primarily affecting the face, hands and feet.[1] Sydenham's chorea results from childhood infection with Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus[2] and is reported to occur in 20–30% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The disease is usually latent, occurring up to 6 months after the acute infection, but may occasionally be the presenting symptom of rheumatic fever. Sydenham's chorea is more common in females than males and most patients are children, below 18 years of age. Adult onset of Sydenham's chorea is comparatively rare and the majority of the adult cases are associated with exacerbation of chorea following childhood Sydenham's chorea.
Syndactyly (from Greek συν- meaning "together" and δακτυλος meaning "finger") is a condition wherein two or more digits are fused together. It occurs normally in some mammals, such as the siamang and diprotodontia,[1] but is an unusual condition in humans.
A synechia is an eye condition where the iris adheres to either the cornea (i.e. anterior synechia) or lens (i.e. posterior synechia). Synechiae can be caused by ocular trauma, iritis or iridocyclitis and may lead to certain types of glaucoma. It is sometimes visible on careful examination but usually more easily through an ophthalmoscope or slit-lamp.
Synesthesia (also spelled synæsthesia or synaesthesia; from the Ancient Greek σύν syn, "together", and αἴσθησις aisthēsis, "sensation") is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.[1][2][3][4] People who report a lifelong history of such experiences are known as synesthetes.
Synovial osteochondromatosis (SOC) (synonyms include synovial chondromatosis, primary synovial chondromatosis, synovial chondrometaplasia) is a rare disease that creates a benign change or proliferation in the synovium or joint-lining tissue, which changes to form bone-forming cartilage. In most occurrences, there is only one joint affected, either the knee, the hip, or the elbow. Rarely involves the TMJ.[1]
A synovial sarcoma (also known as: malignant synovioma[1]) is a rare form of cancer which occurs primarily in the extremities of the arms or legs, often in close proximity to joint capsules and tendon sheaths.[2] As one of the soft tissue sarcomas, it is one of the rarest forms of soft tissue cancer in the world.
Synovitis is the medical term for inflammation of the synovial membrane. This membrane lines joints which possess cavities, known as synovial joints. The condition is usually painful, particularly when the joint is moved. The joint usually swells due to synovial fluid collection.
Synpolydactyly is a joint presentation of syndactyly (fusion of digits) and polydactyly (production of supernumerary digits). This is often a result of a mutation in the HOX D13 gene.[1]
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.[1] The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms.[2] In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms.[3] Syphilis has been known as "the great imitator" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.[2][3]
Syringobulbia is a medical condition in which syrinxes, or fluid-filled cavities, affect the brainstem. This defect normally results from congenital abnormality, trauma or tumor growth.
Syringocystadenoma papilliferum (also known as "Syringadenoma papilliferum") is an apocrine tumor.[1]
Syringomyelia (/sᵻˌrɪŋɡəmaɪˈiːliə, -ɡoʊ-/[1][2]) is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord. This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in pain, paralysis, weakness,[3] and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. There is also a disorder that generally leads to a cape-like pain (extreme pain, pressure, and many other painful symptoms in the area where a cape would be) and temperature sensation along the back and arms. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, to the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.[1] Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms.[1]
Tachycardia, also called tachyarrhythmia, is a heart rate that exceeds the normal resting rate.[1] In general, a resting heart rate over 100 beats per minute is accepted as tachycardia in adults.[1] Heart rates above the resting rate may be normal (such as with exercise) or abnormal (such as with electrical problems within the heart).
Taeniasis is a parasitic disease due to infection with tapeworms belonging to the genus Taenia. The two most important human pathogens in the genus are Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (the beef tapeworm). The third species Taenia asiatica is found only in East Asia. Taeniasis is generally asymptomatic, but severe infection causes weight loss, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, nausea, constipation, chronic indigestion, and loss of appetite.
Tangier disease (also known as Familial alpha-lipoprotein deficiency[1]:535) or Hypoalphalipoproteinemia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a severe reduction in the amount of high density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as "good cholesterol," in the bloodstream.
TAR Syndrome (thrombocytopenia with absent radius) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the absence of the radius bone in the forearm, and a dramatically reduced platelet count. This syndrome may occur as a part of the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a difficult-to-treat and often incurable form of dyskinesia, a disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive body movements. In this form of dyskinesia, the involuntary movements are tardive, meaning they have a slow or belated onset.[1] This neurological disorder, by definition, most frequently occurs as the result of long-term (usually at least 3 months duration) or high-dose use of antipsychotic drugs,[Note 1] or in children and infants as a side effect from usage of drugs for gastrointestinal disorders.[Note 2][2]
Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS), also known as posterior tibial neuralgia, is a compression neuropathy and painful foot condition in which the tibial nerve is compressed as it travels through the tarsal tunnel.[1] This tunnel is found along the inner leg behind the medial malleolus (bump on the inside of the ankle). The posterior tibial artery, tibial nerve, and tendons of the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles travel in a bundle through the tarsal tunnel. Inside the tunnel, the nerve splits into three different segments. One nerve (calcaneal) continues to the heel, the other two (medial and lateral plantar nerves) continue on to the bottom of the foot. The tarsal tunnel is delineated by bone on the inside and the flexor retinaculum on the outside.
Taurodontism is a condition found in the molar teeth of humans whereby the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged vertically at the expense of the roots. As a result, the floor of the pulp and the furcation of the tooth is moved apically down the root. The underlying mechanism of taurodontism is the failure or late invagination of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, which is responsible for root formation and shaping causing an apical shift of the root furcation.[1]
Tay–Sachs disease (also known as GM2 gangliosidosis or hexosaminidase A deficiency) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. In its most common variant (known as infantile Tay–Sachs disease), it causes a progressive deterioration of nerve cells and of mental and physical abilities that begins around seven months of age and usually results in death by the age of four. The disease occurs when harmful quantities of cell membrane components known as gangliosides accumulate in the brain's nerve cells, eventually leading to the premature death of the cells. A ganglioside is a form of sphingolipid, which makes Tay–Sachs disease a member of the sphingolipidoses. There is no known cure or treatment.
The T-cell lymphomas are four types of lymphoma that affect T cells. These account for about one in ten cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[1]
Telangiectasias /tɛlˌæn.dʒiː.ɛkˈteɪ.zi.ə/, also known as spider veins or angioectasias, are small dilated blood vessels[1] near the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, measuring between 0.5 and 1 millimeter in diameter.[2]
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), also known as Lyell's syndrome,[1] is a rare, life-threatening skin condition that is usually caused by a reaction to drugs.[2] The disease causes the top layer of skin (the epidermis) to detach from the lower layers of the skin (the dermis), all over the body, leaving the body susceptible to severe infection. The case fatality ratio ranges from 25 to 30%, and death usually occurs as a result of sepsis and subsequent multiorgan system failure. Treatment primarily involves discontinuing the use of causative agent(s), and supportive care in either the intensive care unit or burn unit of a hospital.[3][4]

Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is an infection characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. These spasms usually last a few minutes each time and occur frequently for three to four weeks.[1] Spasms may be so severe that bone fractures may occur.[2] Other symptoms may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.[1][2] Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. It may take months to recover. About 10% of those infected die.[1]
Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (THBD, BH4D), also called THB or BH4 deficiency, is a rare metabolic disorder that increases the blood levels of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is an amino acid obtained through the diet. It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. If tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is not treated, excess phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.
Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders that can result in the abnormal formation of hemoglobin.[1] Symptoms depend on the type and can vary from none to severe.[2] Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells). Anemia can result in feeling tired and pale skin. There may also be bone problems, an enlarged spleen, yellowish skin, dark urine, and among children slow growth.[2]
Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition in which there is compression of the nerves, arteries, or veins in the passageway from the lower neck to the armpit.[1] There are three main types: neurogenic, venous, and arterial.[1] The neurogenic type is the most common and presents with pain, weakness, and occasionally loss of muscle at the base of the thumb.[1][2] The venous type results in swelling, pain, and possibly a bluish coloration of the arm. The arterial type results in pain, coldness, and paleness of the arm.[2]
Thrombocytopenia refer to a disorder in which there is a relative decrease of thrombocytes, commonly known as platelets, present in the blood.[1]
Thrombocytosis (or thrombocythemia) is the presence of high platelet counts in the blood, and can be either primary (also termed essential and caused by a myeloproliferative disease) or reactive (also termed secondary). Although often symptomless (particularly when it is a secondary reaction), it can predispose to thrombosis in some patients. Thrombocytosis can be contrasted with thrombocytopenia, a loss of platelets in the blood.
Candidiasis is a fungal infection due to any type of Candida (a type of yeast).[2] When it affects the mouth, it is commonly called thrush.[2] Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and throat.[3] Other symptoms may include soreness and problems swallowing.[3] When it affects the vagina, it is commonly called a yeast infection.[2] Signs and symptoms include genital itching, burning, and sometimes a white "cottage cheese-like" discharge from the vagina.[4] Less commonly the penis may be affected, resulting in itchiness.[3] Very rarely, the infection may become invasive spreading throughout the body, resulting in fevers along with other symptoms depending on the parts of the body affected.[5]
Thymic carcinoma is a rare type of thymus gland cancer. It usually spreads, has a high risk of recurrence, and has a poor survival rate. Thymic carcinoma is divided into subtypes, depending on the types of cells in which the cancer began. Also called type C thymoma.
Thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelial cells of the thymus. Thymoma is an uncommon tumor, best known for its association with the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis;[1] thymoma is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis.[2] Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.
Thyroid cancer is a cancer originating from follicular or parafollicular thyroid cells. These cells give rise to both well-differentiated cancers – papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) – and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), whose anaplastic cells are poorly differentiated. The second cell type, the C or parafollicular cell, produces the hormone calcitonin and is the cell of origin for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).[1]
Tick paralysis is the only tick-borne disease that is not caused by an infectious organism. The illness is caused by a neurotoxin produced in the tick's salivary gland. After prolonged attachment, the engorged tick transmits the toxin to its host. The incidence of tick paralysis is unknown. Patients can experience severe respiratory distress (similar to anaphylaxis).
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral infectious disease involving the central nervous system. The disease most often manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis. Although TBE is most commonly recognized as a neurological disorder, mild fever can also occur. Long-lasting or permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae are observed in 10 to 20% of infected patients.
Tietz syndrome, also called Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome or albinism and deafness of Tietz,[1] is an autosomal dominant[2] congenital disorder characterized by deafness and leucism.[3] It is caused by a mutation in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene.[2][4] Tietz syndrome was first described in 1963 by Walter Tietz (1927–2003) a German Physician working in California.[5]
Tinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present.[1] While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring.[2] Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard.[3] The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both.[2] Most of the time, it comes on gradually.[3] In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety or interferes with concentration.[2]
TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (also known as TRAPS,[1][2] Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome[1] or familial Hibernian fever[2]) is a periodic fever syndrome associated with mutations in a receptor for the molecule tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that is inheritable in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with TRAPS have episodic symptoms such as recurrent high fevers, rash, abdominal pain, joint/muscle aches and puffy eyes. TRAPS was first described in 1982 in a boy of Scottish-Irish origin. At that time, it was named familial Hibernian fever.[2]
Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (THS) is a rare disorder characterized by severe and unilateral headaches with orbital pain, along with weakness and paralysis (ophthalmoplegia) of certain eye muscles (extraocular palsies).[1]
TORCH syndrome is a cluster of symptoms caused by congenital infection with toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and other organisms including syphilis, parvovirus, and Varicella zoster.[1]
Torsades de pointes or torsade de pointes (TdP or simply torsade(s)) (French: [tɔʁsad də pwɛ̃t], translated as "twisting of the points"), is a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac death. It is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that exhibits distinct characteristics on the electrocardiogram (ECG). It was described by Dessertenne in 1966.[1] Prolongation of the QT interval can increase a person's risk of developing this abnormal heart rhythm.
Torticollis, also known as wry neck or loxia,[note 1] is a dystonic condition defined by an abnormal, asymmetrical head or neck position, which may be due to a variety of causes. The term torticollis is derived from the Latin words tortus for twisted and collum for neck.[1][2]
Tourette syndrome (TS or simply Tourette's), is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood,[1] characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.
Townes–Brocks syndrome[1] (TBS) is a rare genetic disease that has been described in approximately 200 cases in the published literature. It affects both males and females equally.[2] The condition was first identified in 1972.[2] by Philip L. Townes, MD, PhD, who was at the time a human geneticists and Professor of Pediatrics, and Eric Brocks, MD, who was at the time a medical student, both at the University of Rochester.
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal illness caused by a bacterial toxin. Different bacterial toxins may cause toxic shock syndrome. The causative bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, where TSS is caused by enterotoxin type B or TSST-1, and Streptococcus pyogenes, where it is caused by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins. Streptococcal TSS is sometimes referred to as toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
Toxocariasis is an illness of humans caused by larvae (immature worms) of either the dog roundworm (Toxocara canis), the cat roundworm (Toxocara cati) or the fox roundworm (Toxocara canis). Toxocariasis is often called visceral larva migrans (VLM). Depending on geographic location, degree of eosinophilia, eye and/or pulmonary signs the terms ocular larva migrans (OLM), Weingarten's disease, Frimodt-Møller's syndrome, and eosinophilic pseudoleukemia[1] are applied to toxocariasis. Other terms sometimes or rarely used include nematode ophthalmitis, toxocaral disease, toxocarose, and covert toxocariasis.[2] This zoonotic, helminthic infection is a major cause of blindness and may provoke rheumatic, neurologic, or asthmatic symptoms.[3] Humans normally become infected by ingestion of embryonated eggs (each containing a fully developed larva, L2) from contaminated sources (soil, fresh or unwashed vegetables, or improperly cooked paratenic hosts).[1]
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii.[1] Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no symptoms in adult humans.[2] Occasionally there may be a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes.[3] In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.[3]
Tracheal agenesis is a rare birth defect[1] with a prevalence of less than 1 in 50,000,[2] in which the trachea fails to develop. The defect is normally fatal,[2][3] although occasional cases have been reported of long-term survival following surgical intervention.[3][4]
Tracheobronchomalacia or TBM is a condition characterized by flaccidity of the tracheal support cartilage which leads to tracheal collapse.[1] This condition can also affect the bronchi. There are two forms of this rare condition: primary TB and secondary TB. Primary TB is congenital and starts as early as two years old. It is mainly linked to genetic causes. Secondary TB is acquired and starts in adulthood. It is mainly developed after an accident or chronic inflammation.[2]
Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (also called tracheobronchomegaly) is a very rare congenital disorder of the lung primarily characterized by an abnormal widening of the upper airways.[1] The abnormally widened trachea and mainstem bronchi are associated with recurrent lower respiratory tract infection and copious purulent sputum production, eventually leading to bronchiectasis and other respiratory complications.[2]
A tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF, or TOF; see spelling differences) is an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea. TEF is a common congenital abnormality, but when occurring late in life is usually the sequela of surgical procedures such as a laryngectomy.
Trachoma, also called granular conjunctivitis, Egyptian ophthalmia,[1] and blinding trachoma, is an infectious disease caused by bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections can result in a form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward.[2]
Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) is a slowly developing anemia of early childhood characterized by gradual onset of pallor.
Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a neurological disorder whose key defining characteristic is a temporary but almost total disruption of short-term memory with a range of problems accessing older memories. A person in a state of TGA exhibits no other signs of impaired cognitive functioning but recalls only the last few moments of consciousness, as well as deeply encoded facts of the individual's past, such as his or her own name.[1][2]
Urothelial carcinoma (UCC, also transitional cell carcinoma or TCC) is a type of cancer that typically occurs in the urinary system: the kidney, urinary bladder, and accessory organs. It is the most common type of bladder cancer and cancer of the ureter, urethra, and urachus. It is the second most common type of kidney cancer, but accounts for only five to 10 percent of all primary renal malignant tumors.
Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition in which the spinal cord is inflamed. The inflammation damages nerve fibers, and causes them to lose their myelin coating leading to decreased electrical conductivity in the central nervous system. Transverse implies that the inflammation extends across the entire width of the spinal cord.[1] Partial transverse myelitis and partial myelitis are terms used to define inflammation of the spinal cord that affects part of the width of the spinal cord.[1]
TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome (also known as TRAPS,[1][2] Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome[1] or familial Hibernian fever[2]) is a periodic fever syndrome associated with mutations in a receptor for the molecule tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that is inheritable in an autosomal dominant manner. Individuals with TRAPS have episodic symptoms such as recurrent high fevers, rash, abdominal pain, joint/muscle aches and puffy eyes. TRAPS was first described in 1982 in a boy of Scottish-Irish origin. At that time, it was named familial Hibernian fever.[2]
Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities, involving the ears, eyes, cheekbones, and jawbone. Those affected have normal intelligence.[4]:577 The typical physical features include downward-slanting eyes, micrognathia (a small lower jaw), conductive hearing loss, underdeveloped zygomatic bones, drooping part of the lateral lower eyelids, and malformed or absent ears, but they can vary dramatically between affected people. These physical features can cause problems breathing, hearing, and seeing.
Trevor disease, also known as Fairbank's disease and Trevor's disease, is a congenital bone developmental disorder. There is 1 case per million population. The condition is three times more common in males than in females.
Trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the Trichinella type. During the initial infection invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Migration of larvae to muscle, which occurs about a week after being infected, can cause swelling of the face, inflammation of the whites of the eyes, fever, muscle pains, and a rash. Minor infection may be without symptoms. Complications may include inflammation of heart muscle, central nervous system involvement, and inflammation of the lungs.[1]
Tricho–dento–osseous syndrome is a condition with many features, including amelogenesis imperfecta, subtype hypomaturation-hypoplastic with taurodontism. It is autosomal dominant. It is characterized by curly and kinky hair at infancy that later straightens, absent mineralization of dental enamel, taurodontism and dental hypoplasia. Bone tends to be sclerotic bone and dense on radiograph and CT scan. It is autosomal dominant inheritance.[1]
Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (THE), also known as syndromic or phenotypic diarrhea, is an extremely rare congenital bowel disorder which manifests itself as intractable diarrhea in infants with intrauterine growth retardation, hair and facial abnormalities.[1] Many also have liver disease and abnormalities of the immune system.[1] The associated malabsorption leads to malnutrition and failure to thrive.[1]
Trichomoniasis is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.[2] About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected.[2] When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure.[1] Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex.[1][2] Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.[1]
Trichostasis spinulosa is a common but rarely diagnosed disorder of the hair follicles[1] that clinically gives the impression of blackheads, but the follicles are filled with funnel-shaped, horny plugs which are bundles of vellus hairs.[2]:768
Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterised by brittle hair and intellectual impairment. The word breaks down into tricho – "hair", thio – "sulphur", and dystrophy – "wasting away" or literally "bad nourishment". TTD is associated with a range of symptoms connected with organs of the ectoderm and neuroectoderm. TTD may be subclassified into four syndromes: Approximately half of all patients with trichothiodystrophy have photosensitivity, which divides the classification into syndromes with or without photosensitivity; BIDS and PBIDS, and IBIDS and PIBIDS. Modern covering usage is TTD-P (photosensitive), and TTD.[1]
Trichotillomania (TTM), also known as hair pulling disorder, is an impulse control disorder characterised by a long term urge that results in the pulling out of one's hair.[2] This occurs to such a degree that hair loss can be seen.[2] Efforts to stop pulling hair typically fail. Hair removal may occur anywhere; however, the head and around the eyes are most common. The hair pulling is to such a degree that it results in distress.[1]
Tricuspid atresia is a form of congenital heart disease whereby there is a complete absence of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, there is an absence of right atrioventricular connection. This leads to a hypoplastic (undersized) or absent right ventricle. This defect is contracted during prenatal development, when the heart does not finish developing. It causes the heart to be unable to properly oxygenate the rest of the blood in the body. Because of this, the body does not have enough oxygen to live, so other defects must occur to maintain blood flow. Because of the lack of an A-V connection, an atrial septal defect (ASD) must be present to fill the left ventricle with blood. Also, since there is a lack of a right ventricle there must be a way to pump blood into the pulmonary arteries, and this is accomplished by a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The causes of Tricupsid atresia are unknown.[1]
Tricyclic antidepressant overdose is poisoning caused by excessive medication of the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) type. Symptoms may include elevated body temperature, blurred vision, dilated pupils, sleepiness, confusion, seizures, rapid heart rate, and cardiac arrest.[1] If symptoms have not occurred within six hours of exposure they are unlikely to occur.[2]
Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia. The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours. The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe. Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face. Both forms may occur in the same person.[1] It is one of the most painful conditions and can result in depression.[5]
Historicopous, trigger fingers, or trigger digit (also a sub-set of stenosing tenosynovitis) is a common disorder characterized by catching, snapping or locking of the involved finger flexor tendon, associated with dysfunction and pain.[1] A disparity in size between the flexor tendon and the surrounding retinacular pulley system, most commonly at the level of the first annular (A1) pulley, results in difficulty flexing or extending the finger and the “triggering” phenomenon.[1] The label of trigger finger is used because when the finger unlocks, it pops back suddenly, as if releasing a trigger on a gun.
Trigonocephaly (Greek: 'trigonon' = triangle, 'kephale' = head) is a congenital condition of premature fusion of the metopic suture (Greek: 'metopon' = forehead) leading to a triangular shaped forehead. The merging of the two frontal bones leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion. It may occur syndromic involving other abnormalities or isolated.
Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), also known as fish odor syndrome or fish malodor syndrome,[1] is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3).[2][3] When FMO3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor. A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists where there is no genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.[4]
Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive[1] metabolic disorder which was initially described in 1965.[2]
A trisomy is a type of polysomy in which there are three instances of a particular chromosome, instead of the normal two.[1] A trisomy is a type of aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).
Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), also called HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM) or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)[1] is a medical condition that causes weakness, muscle spasms, and sensory disturbance by human T-lymphotropic virus resulting in paraparesis, weakness of the legs. As the name suggests, it is most common in tropical regions, including the Caribbean.[2] Blood transfusion products are screened for HTLV-1 antibodies, as a preventive measure.[3]
Tropical sprue is a malabsorption disease commonly found in tropical regions, marked with abnormal flattening of the villi and inflammation of the lining of the small intestine.[1] It differs significantly from coeliac sprue. It appears to be a more severe form of environmental enteropathy.[2][3][4]
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness,[1] is a parasitic disease of humans and other animals. It is caused by protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei.[2] There are two types that infect humans, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b.g) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T.b.r.).[1] T.b.g causes over 98% of reported cases.[1] Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas.[1]

Tsukuhara syndrome is an infrequently occurring skeletal dysplasia characterised by a caudal synostosis of the vertebra at birth.[1]
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).[1] Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.[1] The historical term "consumption" came about due to the weight loss.[2] Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.[3]
Tuberculous meningitis is also known as TB meningitis or tubercular meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the meninges—the system of membranes which envelop the central nervous system.[1][2]
A tufted angioma (also known as an "Acquired tufted angioma," "Angioblastoma," "Angioblastoma of Nakagawa," "Hypertrophic hemangioma," "Progressive capillary hemangioma," and "Tufted hemangioma"[1][2]) usually develops in infancy or early childhood on the neck and upper trunk, and is an ill-defined, dull red macule with a mottled appearance, varying from 2 to 5 cm in diameter.[2]:596
Tularemia is a serious infectious disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis.[3] It causes fever, and sometimes ulceration at the site of entry and/or swelling of nearby lymph nodes.[4] It can cause severe pneumonia.[4]
Tungiasis (also known as nigua,[1] pio and bicho de pie,[1] or pique[1] or sand flea disease[2]) is an inflammatory skin disease caused by infection with the female ectoparasitic Tunga penetrans (also known as chigoe flea, jigger, nigua or sand flea), found in the tropical parts of Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and India. Tunga penetrans is the smallest flea in the world, measuring 1 mm across. It is also known in Latin America as the nigua and bicho de pie (Spanish) or bicho de pé (Portuguese), literally "foot bug".[3][4] Tunga penetrans is a member of the genus Tunga, which comprises 13 species.[5][6]
Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), also known as Feto-Fetal Transfusion Syndrome (FFTS) and Twin Oligohydramnios-Polyhydramnios Sequence (TOPS) is a complication of disproportionate blood supply, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. It can affect monochorionic multiples, that is, multiple pregnancies where two or more fetuses share a chorion and hence a single placenta. Severe TTTS has a 60–100% mortality rate.[1]
Typhus is any of several similar diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria.[1] The name comes from the Greek typhus (τύφος) meaning smoky or hazy, describing the state of mind of those affected with typhus. The causative organism Rickettsia is an obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium that cannot survive for long outside living cells. It is transmitted to humans via external parasites such as lice, fleas, and ticks. While "typhoid" means "typhus-like", typhus and typhoid fever are distinct diseases caused by different genera of bacteria.

Uhl's anomaly was first described in 1952 by Dr. Henry Uhl (1921–2009) upon examining one of his patients. [1] It is a very rare congenital heart disease (less than 100 cases 1900–1993) with a partial or total loss of the myocardial muscle in the right ventricle.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum.[1][2] The primary symptom of active disease is abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur. Often symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares.[1] Complications may include megacolon, inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer.[1][3]
Uncombable hair syndrome, also known as Pili trianguli et canaliculi,[1]:639 Spun-glass hair,[2] and Cheveux incoiffables,[3]:765 is a rare structural anomaly of the hair with a variable degree of effect. It was first reported in the early 20th century and was described in the 1970s.[4] It becomes apparent from as little as 3 months to up to 12 years.
Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copy from the other parent.[1] UPD can be the result of heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage meiosis I error) or isodisomy, in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage meiosis II error).[2] Uniparental disomy may have clinical relevance for several reasons. For example, either isodisomy or heterodisomy can disrupt parent-specific genomic imprinting, resulting in imprinting disorders. Additionally, isodisomy leads to large blocks of homozygosity, which may lead to the uncovering of recessive genes, a similar phenomenon seen in children of consanguineous partners.[3]
Unverricht–Lundborg disease (abbreviated ULD or EPM1) is the most common form of an uncommon group of genetic epilepsy disorders called the progressive myoclonus epilepsies.[1] It is caused due to a mutation in the cystatin B gene (CSTB).[2] The disease is named after Heinrich Unverricht, who first described it in 1891, and Herman Bernhard Lundborg, who researched it in greater detail in 1903. ULD onsets in children between the ages of 6 and 16; there are no known cases in which the person was older than 18.[3] Most cases originate from the Baltic region of Europe, though many have been reported from countries in the Mediterranean.[2]
Upington disease, also called Perthes-like hip disease, enchondromata, ecchondromata, and familial dyschondroplasia,[1][2] is an extremely rare[3] autosomal dominant malformation disorder. It has only one published source claiming its existence in three generations of one family from South Africa.[4]
Urachal cancer is a very rare type of cancer arising from the urachus or its remnants.[1] The disease might arise from metaplasic glandular epithelium or embryonic epithelial remnants originating from the cloaca region.[2]
A urachal cyst is a sinus remaining from the allantois during embryogenesis. It is a cyst which occurs in the remnants between the umbilicus and bladder.[1] This is a type of cyst occurring in a persistent portion of the urachus, presenting as an extraperitoneal mass in the umbilical region. It is characterized by abdominal pain, and fever if infected. It may rupture, leading to peritonitis, or it may drain through the umbilicus.[1] Urachal cysts are usually silent clinically until infection, calculi or adenocarcinoma develop.[2]
Urbach–Wiethe disease (also known as lipoid proteinosis and hyalinosis cutis et mucosae) is a rare recessive genetic disorder, with approximately 400 reported cases since its discovery.[1][2][3] It was first officially reported in 1929 by Erich Urbach and Camillo Wiethe,[4][5] although cases may be recognized dating back as early as 1908.[6][7][8]
Urban–Rogers–Meyer syndrome, also known as Prader–Willi habitus, osteopenia, and camptodactyly or Urban syndrome,[1] is an extremely rare inherited congenital disorder first described by Urban et al. (1979).[2][3] It is characterized by genital anomalies, mental retardation, obesity, contractures of fingers, and osteoporosis,[3] though further complications are known.[4][5]
Uremia can be translated as "urea in the blood". Urea is one of the primary components of urine. It can be defined as an excess of amino acid and protein metabolism end products, such as urea and creatinine, in the blood that would be normally excreted in the urine. The Uremic Syndrome can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure (also called renal failure).[1] It is the signs, symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory, regulatory and endocrine function of the kidneys.[2] Both uremia and the uremic syndrome have been used interchangeably to define a very high plasma urea concentration that is the result of renal failure.[1] The latter definition will be used for the rest of the article.
Urticaria pigmentosa (also known as "Generalized eruption of cutaneous mastocytosis (childhood type)"[1]:616 ) is the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis. It is a rare disease caused by excessive numbers of mast cells in the skin that produce hives or lesions on the skin when irritated.
Usher syndrome, also known as Hallgren syndrome, Usher-Hallgren syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa-dysacusis syndrome, or dystrophia retinae dysacusis syndrome,[1] is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in any one of at least 11 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment. It is a leading cause of deafblindness and is at present incurable.
Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the pigmented layer that lies between the inner retina and the outer fibrous layer composed of the sclera and cornea. The uvea consists of the middle layer of pigmented vascular structures of the eye and includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis is an ophthalmic emergency and requires a thorough examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist and urgent treatment to control the inflammation.
The VACTERL association (also VATER association) refers to the non-random co-occurrence of birth defects Vertebral anomalies, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheoesophageal fistula and/or Esophageal atresia, Renal & Radial anomalies and Limb defects. The reason it is called an association, rather than a syndrome, is that while the complications are not pathogenically related they tend to occur together more frequently than expected by chance. In general, the etiology of "associations" is not defined.
Vaginismus, sometimes called vaginism and genito-pelvic pain disorder, is a condition that affects a woman's ability to engage in vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, manual penetration, insertion of tampons or menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations (pap tests). This is the result of an involuntary vaginal muscle spasm, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration painful or impossible. While there is a lack of evidence to definitively identify which muscle is responsible for the spasm, the pubococcygeus muscle, sometimes referred to as the "PC muscle", is most often suggested. Other muscles such as the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles have also been suggested.[1]
Van der Woude syndrome (VDWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by the combination of lower lip pits, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and cleft palate alone (CP). The frequency of orofacial clefts ranges from 1:1000 to 1:500 births worldwide, and there are more than 400 syndromes that involve cleft lip with or without cleft palate.[1] VWS is distinct from other clefting syndromes due to the combination of cleft lip and palate (CLP) and CP within the same family. Other features frequently associated with VWS include hypodontia in 10-81% of cases, narrow arched palate, congenital heart disease, heart murmur and cerebral abnormalities, syndactyly of the hands, polythelia, ankyloglossia, and adhesions between the upper and lower gum pads.[2]
Van Goethem Syndrome, also called radiodigitofacial dysplasia, is a congenital disorder.
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), are bacterial strains of the genus Enterococcus that are resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin.[1]
Variegate porphyria, also known by several other names, is an autosomal dominant porphyria[1] that can have acute (severe but usually not long-lasting) symptoms along with symptoms that affect the skin. The disorder results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the seventh step in heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body's organs. It is a component of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.
Vasculitis (plural: vasculitides)[1] is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation.[2] Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis.[3] Vasculitis is primarily caused by leukocyte migration and resultant damage.
A vasovagal syncope, vasovagal episode or vasovagal response also called a neurocardiogenic syncope[1] is a malaise mediated by the vagus nerve. Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of fainting.[2][3] Vasovagal syncope is most commonly found in adolescents and in older adults.[4]
Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) and Vein of Galen aneurysmal dilations (VGAD) are the most frequent arteriovenous malformations in infants and fetuses.[1][verification needed] VGAM consist of a tangled mass of dilated vessels supplied by an enlarged artery.[2] The malformation increases greatly in size with age, although the mechanism of the increase is unknown.[2] Dilation of the great cerebral vein of Galen is a secondary result of the force of arterial blood either directly from an artery via an arteriovenous fistula or by way of a tributary vein that receives the blood directly from an artery.[1][2] There is usually a venous anomaly downstream from the draining vein that, together with the high blood flow into the great cerebral vein of Galen causes its dilation.[3] The right sided cardiac chambers and pulmonary arteries also develop mild to severe dilation.[4]
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle.[1] The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous portion and is extensively innervated with conducting cardiomyocytes.
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or spring catarrh is a recurrent, bilateral, and self-limiting inflammation of conjunctiva, having a periodic seasonal incidence.
Vestibulocochlear dysfunction progressive familial, known also as familial progressive vestibulocochlear dysfunction is an autosomal dominant disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular areflexia. Patients report feelings of vague dissiness, blurred vision, dysequilibrium in the dark, and progressive hearing impairment.[1]
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a diverse group of animal and human illnesses in which fever and hemorrhage are caused by a viral infection. VHFs may be caused by five distinct families of RNA viruses: the families Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. All types of VHF are characterized by fever and bleeding disorders and all can progress to high fever, shock and death in many cases. Some of the VHF agents cause relatively mild illnesses, such as the Scandinavian nephropathia epidemica (a Hantavirus), while others, such as Ebola virus, can cause severe, life-threatening disease.
Vitamin B12 deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, refers to low blood levels of vitamin B12.[1] A wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur including a decreased ability to think and behavioural and emotional changes such as depression, irritability, and psychosis. Abnormal sensations, changes in reflexes, and poor muscle function can also occur as may inflammation of the tongue, decreased taste, low red blood cells, reduced heart function, and decreased fertility.[2] In young children symptoms include poor growth, poor development, and difficulties with movement.[3] Without early treatment some of the changes may be permanent.[4]
Vitamin E deficiency or hypovitaminosis E is a deficiency of vitamin E. It causes nerve problems due to poor conduction of electrical impulses along nerves due to changes in nerve membrane structure and function.
Vitiligo is a long term skin condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment.[1] The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins. The hair from the skin may also become white.[1] Inside the mouth and nose may also be involved.[2] Typically both sides of the body are affected.[1] Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun. It is more noticeable in people with dark skin.[2] Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.[1]
Von Hippel–Lindau disease (VHL) is a disease which results from a mutation in the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25.3.[1][2][3]
Von Willebrand disease (vWD) (/ˌfʌnˈvɪlᵻbrɑːnt/) is the most common hereditary blood-clotting disorder in humans. An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions.[1] It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known to affect humans and several breeds of dogs. The three forms of vWD are: hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary vWD are: vWD type 1, vWD type 2, and vWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes.[2] Platelet type vWD is also an inherited condition.[3]
Vulvodynia is a chronic pain syndrome that affects the vulvar area and occurs without an identifiable cause.[1] Symptoms typically include a feeling of burning or irritation.[2] For the diagnosis to be made symptoms must last at least 3 months.[3]
Waardenburg syndrome is a rare genetic disorder most often characterized by varying degrees of deafness, minor defects in structures arising from the neural crest, and pigmentation changes.
Wagner's disease is a familial disease of the connective tissue in the eye that can cause reduced visual acuity. Wagner's disease was originally described in 1938. This disorder was frequently confused with Stickler syndrome, but lacks the systemic features and high incidence of retinal detachments. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.
WAGR syndrome (also known as WAGR complex, Wilms tumour-aniridia syndrome, aniridia-Wilms tumour syndrome) is a rare genetic syndrome in which affected children are predisposed to develop Wilms tumour (a tumour of the kidneys), Aniridia (absence of the coloured part of the eye, the iris), Genitourinary anomalies, and Retardation.[1] The G is sometimes instead given as "gonadoblastoma," since the genitourinary anomalies can include tumours of the gonads (testes or ovaries).[2]
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is a type of cancer affecting B cells, a type of white blood cell. The main attributing antibody is immunoglobulin M (IgM). WM is an "indolent lymphoma" (i.e., one that tends to grow and spread slowly). It is a type of lymphoproliferative disease, which shares clinical characteristics with the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas.[1]
Waldmann disease, also known as Waldmann's disease and Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, is a rare disease[1] characterized by enlargement of the lymph vessels supplying the lamina propria of the small intestine.[2]
Wallerian degeneration is a process that results when a nerve fiber is cut or crushed, in which the part of the axon separated from the neuron's cell body degenerates distal to the injury.[1] This is also known as anterograde or orthograde degeneration. A related process known as 'Wallerian-like degeneration' occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases, especially those where axonal transport is impaired.[2] Primary culture studies suggest that a failure to deliver sufficient quantities of the essential axonal protein NMNAT2 is a key initiating event.[3]
Wallis–Zieff–Goldblatt syndrome is a rare condition characterized by inherited skeletal disorders manifested mainly as rhizomelic short stature and lateral clavicular defects.[1] It is also known as Cleidorhizomelic syndrome.[2]
Wandering spleen (or Pelvic spleen) is a rare medical disease caused by the loss or weakening of the ligaments that help to hold the spleen stationary.
Micro syndrome also known as WARBM, and Warburg–Sjo–Fledelius syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, microcornea, congenital cataract, intellectual or developmental disability, optic atrophy, and hypogenitalism.[1]
Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (or, more generally, Anticoagulant-induced skin necrosis) is a condition in which skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis (tissue death) occurs due to acquired protein C deficiency following treatment with anti-vitamin K anticoagulants (coumadins, such as warfarin).[1]
Warkany syndrome 1 was an X-chromosome linked recessive genetic condition originally described by Joseph Warkany in 1961 as part of an article on intrauterine growth retardation[1] - the condition is no longer diagnosed. The family history was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance of intrauterine growth retardation and small head size, but these features are not unique to this condition and no linkage to a specific gene was ever established. In fact, the condition appears to have been abandoned, given that the OMIM number (308400) assigned to it ([1]) and listed in a review article on X-linked mental retardation[2] has been removed from the OMIM database. Furthermore, this condition is no longer mentioned in a more recent review of X-linked mental retardation.[3]
Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome (WFS), hemorrhagic adrenalitis or fulminant meningococcemia is defined as adrenal gland failure due to bleeding into the adrenal glands, commonly caused by severe bacterial infection: Typically the pathogen is the meningococcus Neisseria meningitidis.[1]
Watson syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by Lisch nodules of the ocular iris, axillary/inguinal freckling, pulmonary valvular stenosis, relative macrocephaly, short stature, and neurofibromas.[1]
Weaver syndrome (also called Weaver-Smith syndrome) is an extremely rare congenital disorder associated with rapid growth beginning in the prenatal period and continuing through the toddler and youth years. It is characterized by advanced osseous maturation, and distinctive craniofacial, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities.[1] It was first described by Dr. David Weaver in 1974.[2] It is similar to Sotos syndrome.
Panniculitis is a group of diseases whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin - panniculus adiposus).[1] Symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue.
Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is the combined presence of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff's syndrome. Due to the close relationship between these two disorders, people with both are usually diagnosed with WKS, as a single syndrome.
Wernicke's encephalopathy (or Wernicke's disease) refers to the presence of neurological symptoms caused by biochemical lesions of the central nervous system after exhaustion of B-vitamin reserves, in particular thiamine (vitamin B1). The condition is part of a larger group of diseases related to thiamine insufficiency, including beriberi in all its forms, and Korsakoff syndrome. When Wernicke's encephalopathy occurs simultaneously with Korsakoff syndrome it is known as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.[1][2]
White sponge nevus (WSN, or white sponge naevus, Cannon's disease, hereditary leukokeratosis of mucosa, white sponge nevus of Cannon, familial white folded dysplasia,[1][2] or oral epithelial nevus),[3] is an autosomal dominant[4] condition of the oral mucosa (the mucous membrane lining of the mouth). It is caused by a mutations in certain genes coding for keratin, which causes a defect in the normal process of keratinization of the mucosa. This results in lesions which are thick, white and velvety on the inside of the cheeks within the mouth. Usually, these lesions are present from birth or develop during childhood. The condition is entirely harmless, and no treatment is required
Wiedemann–Rautenstrauch (WR) syndrome [ˈviːdəman ˈʁa͜ʊtən.ʃtʁa͜ʊx], also known as neonatal progeroid syndrome,[1] is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome.
Wildervanck syndrome is a developmental disorder that may be characterized by accessory tragi.[1]
Williams syndrome (WS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body.[4] Facial features frequently include a broad forehead, short nose, and full cheeks, an appearance which has been described as "elfin".[4][3] Mild to moderate intellectual disability with particular problems with visual spatial tasks such as drawing and fewer problems with language are typical.[4] Those affected often have an outgoing personality and interact readily with strangers.[4][3] Problems with teeth, heart problems, especially supravalvular aortic stenosis, and periods of high blood calcium are common.[4][2]
Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults.[1] It is named after Dr. Max Wilms, the German surgeon (1867–1918) who first described it.[2]
Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin, and itchiness. Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not.[1]
Wilson-Turner Syndrome (WTS), also known as Mental Retardation X Linked Syndromic 6 (MRXS6), or Mental Retardation X Linked with Gynecomastia and Obesity is a congenital condition characterized by intellectual disability and associated with childhood-onset obesity.[1] It is found to be linked to the X chromosome and caused by a mutation in the HDAC8 gene, which is located on the q arm at locus 13.1. Individuals with Wilson–Turner syndrome have a spectrum of physical characteristics including dysmorphic facial feature, hypogonadism, and short stature. Females generally have milder phenotype than males. The study of X-linked mental retardation began in 1943 when Martin and Bell reported a family exhibiting sex-linked mental retardation.[2] However, this syndrome was not recognized until 1991. Wilson studied 14 males from 3 successive generations that presented hypogonadism, mental retardation, gynecomastia, short stature, among other symptoms.[3] Eventually, this disorder was ruled distinct from a syndrome presented by Prader and Willi (Prader-Willi syndrome) because of its mode of inheritance, gynecomastia, and presence of small hands and feet.[4] However, there are some speculations that this syndrome is in the same spectrum as the Cornelia de Lange syndrome.[5] This disorder affects all demographics equally and is seen in less than one in one million people.[6]
Winchester syndrome is a rare congenital connective tissue disease described in 1969,[1] of which the main characteristics are short stature, marked contractures of joints, opacities in the cornea, a coarse face, dissolution of the carpal and tarsal bones (in the hands and feet, respectively) and osteoporosis. Appearances resemble rheumatoid arthritis. Increased uronic acid is demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts from the skin and to a lesser degree in both parents. Despite initial tests not showing increased mucopolysaccharide excretion, the disease was regarded as a mucopolysaccharidosis.[1]
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and bloody diarrhea (secondary to the thrombocytopenia).[1] It is also sometimes called the eczema-thrombocytopenia-immunodeficiency syndrome in keeping with Aldrich's original description in 1954.[2] The WAS-related disorders of X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and X-linked congenital neutropenia (XLN) may present similar but less severe symptoms and are caused by mutations of the same gene.
Wolcott–Rallison syndrome, WRS, is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder with infancy-onset diabetes mellitus, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, osteopenia, mental retardation or developmental delay, and hepatic and renal dysfunction as main clinical findings. Patients with WRS have mutations in the EIF2AK3 gene, which encodes the pancreatic eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3.[1]
Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (WPW) is one of several disorders of the electrical system of the heart that are commonly referred to as pre-excitation syndromes.
Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), also known as chromosome deletion Dillan 4p syndrome, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS) or Pitt syndrome,[1][2] was first described in 1961 by Americans Herbert L. Cooper and Kurt Hirschhorn[3] and, thereafter, gained worldwide attention by publications by the German Ulrich Wolf, and Hirschhorn and their co-workers, specifically their articles in the German scientific magazine Humangenetik.[4][5] It is a characteristic phenotype resulting from a partial deletion of chromosomal material of the short arm of chromosome 4 (del(4p16.3)).[6]
Wolfram syndrome, also called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness), is a rare autosomal-recessive genetic disorder that causes childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness as well as various other possible disorders.[2]
Woodhouse–Sakati syndrome, also called hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus, intellectual disability and extrapyramidal syndrome,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive[2] multisystem disorder which causes malformations throughout the body, and deficiencies affecting the endocrine system.[3]
Worster-Drought syndrome is a form of congenital suprabulbar paresis that occurs in some children with cerebral palsy. It is caused by inadequate development of the corticobulbar tracts and causes problems with the mouth and tongue including impaired swallowing.[1] A similar syndrome in adults is called anterior opercular syndrome.[1][2]
Worth syndrome, also known as benign form of Worth hyperostosis corticalis generalisata with torus platinus, autosomal dominant osteosclerosis, autosomal dominant endosteal hyperostosis or Worth disease,[1][2] is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder that is caused by a mutation in the LRP5 gene.[3] It is characterized by increased bone density and benign bony structures on the palate.[1][3][4][5]
Wrinkly skin syndrome is a hereditary connective tissue disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.[1]
Writer's cramp, also called mogigraphia and scrivener's palsy, is a disorder caused by cramps or spasms of certain muscles of the hand and/or forearm, and presents itself while performing fine motor tasks, such as writing or playing an instrument.[1][2] Writer's cramp is a task-specific focal dystonia of the hand.[3] 'Focal' refers to the symptoms being limited to one location (the hand in this case), and 'task-specific' means that symptoms first occur only when the individual engages in a particular activity. Writer's cramp first affects an individual by interfering with their ability to write, especially for prolonged periods of time.[2]
Xanthinuria, also known as xanthine oxidase deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder causing the accumulation of xanthine. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme xanthine oxidase.
Hereditary stomatocytosis describes a number of inherited autosomal dominant human conditions which affect the red blood cell, in which the membrane or outer coating of the cell 'leaks' sodium and potassium ions.
Xeroderma or xerodermia (also known as xerosis cutis[1]), derived from the Greek words for "dry skin", is a condition involving the integumentary system, which in most cases can safely be treated with emollients or moisturizers. Xeroderma occurs most commonly on the scalp, lower legs, arms, hands, the knuckles, the sides of the abdomen, and thighs. Symptoms most associated with xeroderma are scaling (the visible peeling of the outer skin layer), itching, and skin cracking.[2]
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of DNA repair in which the ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is deficient.[2]:574 In extreme cases, all exposure to sunlight must be forbidden, no matter how small; as such, individuals with the disease are often colloquially referred to as "Moon child".[3] Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma[4] are the two most common causes of death in XP victims. This disease is present in both genders and in all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States.[5] XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people[4] than in other groups.
Xerophthalmia, also known as dry eyes is a medical condition in which the eye fails to produce tears. It may be caused by vitamin A deficiency, which is sometimes used to describe that condition, although there may be other causes.
Xerostomia (also termed dry mouth[1] as a symptom or dry mouth syndrome[2] as a syndrome) is dryness in the mouth (xero- + stom- + -ia), which may be associated with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow (hyposalivation), or have no identifiable cause.
X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is a genetic disorder[1] that mainly affects males. It involves many endocrine tissues in the body, especially the adrenal glands.
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells,[2] which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria.[3] XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births[4] and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000[5] male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody. Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.[3]
X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) (also known as "Steroid sulfatase deficiency," and "X-linked recessive ichthyosis"[1]) (from the Ancient Greek 'ichthys' meaning 'fish') is a skin condition caused by the hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme that affects 1 in 2000 to 1 in 6000 males.[2] XLI manifests with dry, scaly skin[3] and is due to deletions[4][5] or mutations[6] in the STS gene. XLI can also occur in the context of larger deletions causing contiguous gene syndromes.[4] Treatment is largely aimed at alleviating the skin symptoms.[7]
X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is an immunodeficiency disorder in which the body produces very few T cells and NK cells. In the absence of T cell help, B cells become defective.[1] It is an x-linked recessive trait, stemming from a mutated (abnormal) version of the IL2-RG gene located at xq13.1 on the X-chromosome, which is shared between receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21.[2][3]
XX male syndrome (also called de la Chapelle syndrome, for Albert de la Chapelle, who characterized it in 1972[1][2]) is a rare sex chromosomal disorder. Usually, it is caused by unequal crossing over between X and Y chromosomes during meiosis in the father, which results in the X chromosome containing the normally-male SRY gene. When this X combines with a normal X from the mother during fertilization, the result is an XX male.
XYY syndrome is a genetic condition in which a human male has an extra male (Y) chromosome, giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46. This produces a 47,XYY karyotype, which occurs every 1 in 1,000 male births.
Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue.[3][4] The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, 2 to 5 centimeters in diameter.[4] The center may break open and form an ulcer.[4] This initial skin lesion typically heals after three to six months.[5] After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin lesions may appear.[4] The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open.[5] The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen.[5] After five years or more large areas of skin may die, leaving a scar.[4]
Yellow fever is an acute viral disease.[3] In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches.[3] Symptoms typically improve within five days.[3] In some people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin.[3] If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased.[3]
Yellow nail syndrome, also known as "primary lymphedema associated with yellow nails and pleural effusion,"[1]:849 is a very rare medical syndrome that includes pleural effusions, lymphedema (due to under development of the lymphatic vessels) and yellow dystrophic nails. Approximately 40% will also have bronchiectasis. It is also associated with chronic sinusitis and persistent coughing. It usually affects adults.[2][3]:665[4]
The genetic disorder Yemenite deaf-blind hypopigmentation syndrome, also known as Warburg-Thomsen syndrome,[1] is a condition caused by a mutation on the SRY-related HMG-box gene 10[2] (not SOX10).[3]
Bacillus
Yersiniosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus Yersinia. In the United States, most yersiniosis infections among humans are caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. The infection by Y. enterocolitica is also known as pseudotuberculosis.[1] Yersiniosis is mentioned as a specific zoonotic disease to prevent outbreaks in European Council Directive 92/117/EEC.[2]
Yersinia enterocolitica is a Gram-negative bacillus-shaped bacterium, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is motile at temperatures of 22–29°C, but becomes nonmotile at normal human body temperature.[1][2] Y. enterocolitica infection causes the disease yersiniosis, which is an animal-borne disease occurring in humans, as well as in a wide array of animals such as cattle, deer, pigs, and birds. Many of these animals recover from the disease and become carriers; these are potential sources of contagion despite showing no signs of disease.[3] The bacterium infects the host by sticking to its cells using trimeric autotransporter adhesins.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes Far East scarlet-like fever in humans, who occasionally get infected zoonotically, most often through the food-borne route.[1] Animals are also infected by Y. pseudotuberculosis. The bacterium is urease positive.
Yim–Ebbin syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of arms, a cleft lip and palate, hydrocephalus, and an iris coloboma.[1] It was first described by Yim and Ebbin in 1982,[2] and later by Thomas and Donnai in 1994.[3] In 1996, a third case was reported by Froster et al. who suggested that the three cases were related and represented a distinct syndrome.[4] In 2000, a similar case was reported by Pierri et al.[5]
Young–Madders syndrome, alternatively known as Pseudotrisomy 13 syndrome or holoprosencephaly–polydactyly syndrome, is a genetic disorder resulting from defective and duplicated chromosomes which result in holoprosencephaly, polydactyly, facial malformations and mental retardation, with a significant variance in the severity of symptoms being seen across known cases.[1] Many cases often suffer with several other genetic disorders, and some have presented with hypoplasia, cleft lip, cardiac lesions and other heart defects. In one case in 1991 and another in 2000 the condition was found in siblings who were the product of incest. Many cases are diagnosed prenatally and often in siblings.[1] Cases are almost fatal in the prenatal stage with babies being stillborn.
Yunis–Varon syndrome (YVS), also called cleidocranial dysplasia with micrognathia, absent thumbs and distal aphalangia,[1][2] is an extremely rare[3] autosomal recessive[4] multisystem congenital disorder[5] which affects the skeletal system, ectodermal tissue, heart and respiratory system.
Zadik–Barak–Levin syndrome (ZBLS) is a congenital disorder in humans. Presenting conditions include primary hypothyroidism, cleft palate, hypodontia, and ectodermal dysplasia. It is the result of an embryonic defect in the mesodermal-ectodermal midline development.
ZAP70 deficiency, or zeta-chain-associated protein 70 kD deficiency,[1] is a rare autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).[2]
Zamzam–Sheriff–Phillips syndrome is a rare[1] autosomal recessive congenital disorder. It is characterized by aniridia, ectopia lentis, abnormal upper incisors and intellectual disability.[2] Not a lot of research has been undertaken of this particular disease so thus far there is no known gene that affects this condition. However it has been hypothesised that the symptoms described are found at a particular gene, though intellectual disability is believed to be due to a different genetic cause.
Zellweger syndrome, also called cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the reduction or absence of functional peroxisomes in the cells of an individual.[1] It is one of a family of disorders called leukodystrophies. Zellweger syndrome is named after Hans Zellweger (1909–1990), a Swiss-American pediatrician, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at the University of Iowa who researched this disorder.[2][3]
A Zenker's diverticulum, also pharyngoesophageal diverticulum, also pharyngeal pouch, also hypopharyngeal diverticulum, is a diverticulum of the mucosa of the pharynx, just above the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. above the upper sphincter of the esophagus). It is a pseudo diverticulum (not involving all layers of the esophageal wall).
Zieve's syndrome is an acute metabolic condition that can occur during withdrawal from prolonged alcohol abuse. It is defined by hemolytic anemia (with spur cells and acanthocytes), hyperlipoproteinaemia (excessive blood lipoprotein), jaundice (elevation of unconjugated bilirubin), and abdominal pain.[1] The underlying cause is liver delipidization. This is distinct from alcoholic hepatitis which, however, may present simultaneously or develop later.
Zinc deficiency can occur in soil, plants, and animals. In animals, including humans, it is defined either qualitatively as insufficient zinc to meet the needs of the body and thereby causing clinical manifestations, or quantitatively as a serum zinc level below the normal range; however, serum zinc is not a reliable biomarker for zinc status in humans, as a decrease in serum concentration is only detectable after long-term or severe depletion.[1] Novel zinc biomarkers, such as the erythrocyte LA:DGLA ratio, have shown promise in pre-clinical and clinical trials and are being developed to more accurately detect dietary zinc deficiency.[2][3][4] Zinc deficiency affects about 2.2 billion people around the world.[5]
Zinc toxicity is a medical condition involving an overdose on, or toxic overexposure to, zinc. Such toxicity levels have been seen to occur at ingestion of greater than 225 mg of zinc.[1] Excessive absorption of zinc can suppress copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to bacteria, plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.[2][3][4] Zinc is an essential trace metal with very low toxicity in humans.[1][5]
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a " Gastrinoma" which is a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes Gastrin; resultant hypergastrinemia causes gastric acid hypersecretion. This leads to growth of gastric mucosa, increase in number of Parietal cells and proliferation of gastric ECL cells. Most Gastrinomas are present in duodenum (50-70%), pancreas ( 20-40%) and other intraabdominal site. ZES may occur sporadically or as part of an autosomal dominant familial syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). The primary tumor is usually located in the pancreas, duodenum or abdominal lymph nodes, but ectopic locations have also been described (e.g., heart, ovary, gallbladder, liver, kidney).[1]
Zonular cataract and nystagmus, also referred as Nystagmus with congenital zonular cataract is a rare[1] congenital disease associated with Nystagmus and zonular cataract of the eye.
Zori–Stalker–Williams syndrome, also known as pectus excavatum, macrocephaly, short stature and dysplastic nails,[1] is a rare autosomal dominant[2] congenital disorder associated with a range of features such as pectus excavatum, macrocephaly and dysplastic nails, familial short stature, developmental delay and distinctive facies.[3][4] Further signs are known to be associated with this syndrome.[5]
Zunich–Kaye syndrome, also known as Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome, is a rare congenital ichthyosis first described in 1983.[1] It is also referred to as CHIME syndrome, after its main symptoms (colobomas, heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis, intellectual disability, and either ear defects or epilepsy).[2] It is a congenital[3] syndrome with only a few cases studied and published.[2]
Zygomycosis is the broadest term to refer to infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis[1] (after Mucorales), phycomycosis[2] (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus).[3] These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity.[4] Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection.[2][5][6] These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.[7]
